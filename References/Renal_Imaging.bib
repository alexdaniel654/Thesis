  abstract = {TensorFlow [1] is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.},

  abstract = {Background: Magnetic resonance relaxometry (MRR) offers highly reproducible pixel-wise parametric maps of T1 and T2 relaxation times, reflecting specific tissue properties, while diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) is a promising technique for the characterization of microstructural changes, depending on the directionality of molecular motion. Both MMR and DTI may be used for non-invasive assessment of parenchymal changes caused by kidney injury or graft dysfunction. Methods: We examined 46 patients with kidney transplantation and 16 healthy controls, using T1/T2 relaxometry and DTI at 3 T. Twenty-two early transplants and 24 late transplants were included. Seven of the patients had prior renal biopsy (all of them dysfunctional allografts; 6/7 with tubular atrophy and 7/7 with interstitial fibrosis). Results: Compared to healthy controls, T1 and T2 relaxation times in the renal parenchyma were increased after transplantation, with the highest T1/T2 values in early transplants (T1: 1700 \&plusmn; 53 ms/T2: 83 \&plusmn; 6 ms compared to T1: 1514 \&plusmn; 29 ms/T2: 78 \&plusmn; 4 ms in controls). Medullary and cortical ADC/FA values were decreased in early transplants and highest in controls, with medullary FA values showing the most pronounced difference. Cortical renal T1, mean medullary FA and corticomedullary differentiation (CMD) values correlated best with renal function as measured by eGFR (cortical T1: r = \&minus;0.63, p \&lt; 0.001; medullary FA: r = 0.67, p \&lt; 0.001; FA CMD: r = 0.62, p \&lt; 0.001). Mean medullary FA proved to be a significant predictor for tubular atrophy (p \&lt; 0.001), while cortical T1 appeared as a significant predictor of interstitial fibrosis (p = 0.003). Conclusion: Cortical T1, medullary FA, and FA CMD might serve as new imaging biomarkers of renal function and histopathologic microstructure.},

Primary indications of kidney biopsy are glomerular hematuria/proteinuria with or without renal dysfunction and unexplained renal failure. Kidney biopsy is usually performed in prone position but in certain situations, supine and lateral positions may be required. Biopsy needles have changed with times from Vim\textendash Silverman needle to Tru-cut needle to spring-loaded automatic gun. The procedure has also changed from blind bedside kidney biopsy to ultrasound marking to real-time ultrasound guidance to rarely computerized tomography guidance and laparoscopic and open biopsy. In very specific situations, transjugular kidney biopsy may be required. Most of the centers do kidney biopsy on short 1-day admission, whereas some take it as an outdoor procedure. For critical interpretation of kidney biopsy, adequate sample and clinical information are mandatory. Tissue needs to be stained with multiple stains for delineation of various components of kidney tissue. Many consider that electron microscopy (EM) is a must for all kidney biopsies, but facilities for EM are limited even in big centers. Sophisticated tests such as immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization are useful adjuncts for definitive diagnosis in certain situations.},

Materials and Methods: This animal study was IACUC approved. Seventeen male, C57BL/6 mice were divided into control (n = 2) and experimental groups (n = 15), the latter fed a 3, 5-dicarbethoxy-1, 4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) supplemented diet, inducing hepatic fibrosis. Ex vivo liver specimens were imaged using an 11.7T MRI scanner. Spin-echo pulsed field gradient and multi-echo spin-echo acquisitions were used to generate parametric ADC and T2 maps, respectively. Degrees of fibrosis were determined by the evaluation of a pathologist as well as digital image analysis. Scatterplot graphs comparing ADC and T2 to degrees of fibrosis were generated and correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: Strong correlation was found between degrees of hepatic fibrosis and ADC with higher degrees of fibrosis associated with lower hepatic ADC values. Moderate correlation between hepatic fibrosis and T2 values was seen with higher degrees of fibrosis associated with lower T2 values. Conclusion: Inverse relationships between degrees of fibrosis and both ADC and T2 are seen, highlighting the utility of these parameters in the ongoing development of an MRI methodology to quantify hepatic fibrosis.

A problem of echo-planar images is the geometrical distortions that obtain near junctions between tissues of differing magnetic susceptibility. This results in distorted diffusion-tensor maps. To resolve this we suggest acquiring two images for each diffusion gradient; one with bottom-up and one with top-down traversal of k-space in the phase-encode direction. This achieves the simultaneous goals of providing information on the underlying displacement field and intensity maps with adequate spatial sampling density even in distorted areas. The resulting DT maps exhibit considerably higher geometric fidelity, as assessed by comparison to an image volume acquired using a conventional 3D MR technique.},

In addition a susceptibility-induced field can be supplied and will be incorporated into the calculations in a way that accurately reflects that the two fields (susceptibility- and EC-induced) behave differently in the presence of subject movement. The method is based on registering the individual volumes to a model free prediction of what each volume should look like, thereby enabling its use on high b-value data where the contrast is vastly different in different volumes. In addition we show that the linear EC-model commonly used is insufficient for the data used in the present paper (high spatial and angular resolution data acquired with Stejskal\textendash Tanner gradients on a 3T Siemens Verio, a 3T Siemens Connectome Skyra or a 7T Siemens Magnetome scanner) and that a higher order model performs significantly better.

A flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) ASL sequence was performed with respiratory triggering in all subjects and under free-breathing conditions in five transplant subjects. Thirty-two control/tag pairs were acquired and processed using a single-compartment model. Perfusion in native and transplanted kidneys was compared above and below an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) threshold of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and correlations with eGFR were determined. Results In many of the transplanted kidneys, major feeding vessels in the coronal plane required a slice orientation sagittal to the kidney. Renal motion during the examination was observed in native and transplant subjects and was corrected with registration. Cortical perfusion correlated with eGFR in native (r=0.85, P=.002) and transplant subjects (r=0.61, P=.02). For subjects with eGFR {$>$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, native kidneys demonstrated greater cortical (P=.01) and medullary (P=.04) perfusion than transplanted kidneys. For subjects with eGFR {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, native kidneys demonstrated greater medullary perfusion (P=.04) compared to transplanted kidneys. Free-breathing acquisitions provided renal perfusion measurements that were slightly lower compared to the coached/triggered technique, although no statistical differences were observed. Conclusion In conclusion, FAIR-ASL was able to measure renal perfusion in subjects with native and transplanted kidneys, potentially providing a clinically viable technique for monitoring kidney function.},

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the result of too few nephrons to maintain homeostasis. Currently, nephron number can only be determined invasively or as a terminal assessment. Due to a lack of tools to measure and track nephron number in the living, the early stages of CKD often go unrecognized, preventing early intervention that might halt the progression of CKD. In this work, we present a technique to directly measure glomerular number (Nglom) and volume in vivo in the rat kidney (n = 8) using MRI enhanced with the novel contrast agent cationized ferritin (CFE-MRI). Adult male rats were administered intravenous cationized ferritin (CF) and imaged in vivo with MRI. Glomerular number was measured and each glomerulus was spatially mapped in 3D in the image. Mean apparent glomerular volume (aVglom) and intrarenal distribution of the individual glomerular volume (IGV), were also measured. These metrics were compared between images of the same kidneys scanned in vivo and ex vivo with CFE-MRI. In vivo Nglom and aVglom correlated to ex vivo metrics within the same kidneys and were within 10\% of Nglom and aVglom previously validated by stereologic methods. This is the first report of direct in vivo measurements of Nglom and aVglom, introducing an opportunity to investigate mechanisms of renal disease progression and therapeutic response over time.},

There are currently no tools to identify nephropenia in clinical or preclinical diagnostics. Such new methods could uncover novel mechanisms and therapies for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and reveal how variation among traits can affect renal function and morphology. Here we used cationized ferritin (CF)\textendash enhanced MRI (CFE-MRI) to investigate the relationship between glomerular number (\emph{N}\textsubscript{glom}) and volume (\emph{V}\textsubscript{glom}) in kidneys of healthy wild-type mice and mice with oligosyndactylism (Os/\textsuperscript{+}), a model of congenital nephron reduction. Mice were injected with CF and perfused, and the resected kidneys were imaged with 7T MRI to detect CF-labeled glomeruli. CFE-MRI was used to measure the intrarenal distribution of individual glomerular volumes and revealed two major populations of glomeruli distinguished by size. Spatial mapping revealed that the largest glomeruli were located in the juxtamedullary region in both wild-type and Os/\textsuperscript{+} mice and the smallest population located in the cortex. Os/\textsuperscript{+} mice had about a 50\% reduction and 35\% increase of \emph{N}\textsubscript{glom} and \emph{V}\textsubscript{glom}, respectively, in both glomerular populations compared with wild type, consistent with glomerular hypertrophy in the Os/\textsuperscript{+} mice.

We used a recently published systematic review paper, which included a detailed summary of renal BOLD MRI technical parameters and areas of investigation in its supplementary material, as the starting point in developing the survey questionnaires for seeking consensus. Survey data were collected via the Delphi consensus process from 24 researchers on renal BOLD MRI exam preparation, data acquisition, data analysis, and interpretation. Consensus was defined as {$\geq$} 75\% unanimity in response. Among 31 survey questions, 14 achieved consensus resolution, 12 showed clear respondent preference (65\textendash 74\% agreement), and 5 showed equal (50/50\%) split in opinion among respondents. Recommendations for subject preparation, data acquisition, processing and reporting are given based on the survey results and review of the literature. These technical recommendations are aimed towards increased inter-site harmonization, a first step towards standardization of renal BOLD MRI protocols across sites. We expect this to be an iterative process updated dynamically based on progress in the field.},

Unfortunately, there are no techniques to assess Nglom and Vglom in intact kidneys. This work demonstrates the use of cationized ferritin (CF) as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent to measure Nglom and Vglom in viable human kidneys donated to science. The kidneys were obtained from patients with varying levels of cardiovascular and renal disease. CF was intravenously injected into three viable human kidneys. A fourth control kidney was perfused with saline. After fixation, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy confirmed binding of CF to the glomerulus. The intact kidneys were imaged with three-dimensional MRI and CF-labeled glomeruli appeared as punctate spots. Custom software identified, counted, and measured the apparent volumes of CF-labeled glomeruli, with an {$\sim$}6\% false positive rate. These measurements were comparable to stereological estimates. The MRI-based technique yielded a novel whole kidney distribution of glomerular volumes. Histopathology demonstrated that the distribution of CF-labeled glomeruli may be predictive of glomerular and vascular disease. Variations in CF distribution were quantified using image texture analyses, which be a useful marker of glomerular sclerosis. This is the first report of direct measurement of glomerular number and volume in intact human kidneys.},

  abstract = {Techniques to measure morphological parameters, such as glomerular (and thereby nephron) number, glomerular size, and kidney volume, have been vital to understanding factors contributing to chronic kidney disease (CKD). These techniques have also been important to understanding the associations between CKD and other systemic and cardiovascular diseases and have led to the identification of developmental risk factors for these pathologies. However, existing techniques in quantitative kidney morphology are resource- and time-consuming and are destructive to the organ. This review discusses the emerging generation of techniques to study kidney morphology quantitatively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the intravenous injection of the superparamagnetic nanoparticle cationic ferritin, which binds to the glomerular basement membrane. A primary advantage of MRI over previously established techniques is the ability to quantify morphology in the intact organ with minimal sample preparation. We highlight areas of research where MRI-based morphological measurements will be helpful in animal models and possibly diagnostic clinical nephrology, discuss technical challenges in light of the progress in MRI techniques to date, and identify novel measurements that may be possible using MRI, both ex vivo and in vivo.},

We here present the validation of {$\Delta$}ADC for fibrosis assessment in a cohort of 164 patients undergoing biopsy and compare it with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and other plasmatic parameters for the detection of fibrosis.This monocentric cross-sectional study included 164 patients undergoing renal biopsy at the Nephrology Department of the University Hospital of Geneva between October 2014 and May 2018. Patients underwent diffusion-weighted imaging, and T1 and T2 mappings, within 1\,week after biopsy. MRI results were compared with gold standard histology for fibrosis assessment.Absolute cortical ADC or cortical T1 values correlated poorly to IF assessed by the biopsy, whereas {$\Delta$}ADC was highly correlated to IF (r=-0.52, P\,\&lt;\,0.001) and eGFR (r\,=\,0.37, P\,\&lt;\,0.01), in both native and allograft patients. {$\Delta$}T1 displayed a lower, but significant, correlation to IF and eGFR, whereas T2 did not correlate to IF nor to eGFR. {$\Delta$}ADC, {$\Delta$}T1 and eGFR were independently associated with kidney fibrosis, and their combination allowed detection of extensive fibrosis with good specificity.{$\Delta$}ADC is better correlated to IF than absolute cortical or medullary ADC values. {$\Delta$}ADC, {$\Delta$}T1 and eGFR are independently associated to IF and allow the identification of patients with extensive IF.},

  abstract = {The ability to noninvasively assess skeletal muscle microstructure, which predicts function and disease, would be of significant clinical value. One method that holds this promise is diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI), which is sensitive to the microscopic diffusion of water within tissues and has become ubiquitous in neuroimaging as a way of assessing neuronal structure and damage. However, its application to the assessment of changes in muscle microstructure associated with injury, pathology, or age remains poorly defined, because it is difficult to precisely control muscle microstructural features in vivo. However, recent advances in additive manufacturing technologies allow precision-engineered diffusion phantoms with histology informed skeletal muscle geometry to be manufactured. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop skeletal muscle phantoms at relevant size scales to relate microstructural features to MRI-based diffusion measurements. A digital light projection based rapid 3D printing method was used to fabricate polyethylene glycol diacrylate based diffusion phantoms with (1) idealized muscle geometry (no geometry; fiber sizes of 30, 50, or 70\,{$\mu$}m or fiber size of 50\,{$\mu$}m with 40\% of walls randomly deleted) or (2) histology-based geometry (normal and after 30-days of denervation) containing 20\% or 50\% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mean absolute percent error (8\%) of the printed phantoms indicated high conformity to templates when ``fibers'' were {$>$}50\,{$\mu$}m. A multiple spin-echo echo planar imaging diffusion sequence, capable of acquiring diffusion weighted data at several echo times, was used in an attempt to combine relaxometry and diffusion techniques with the goal of separating intracellular and extracellular diffusion signals. When fiber size increased (30\textendash 70\,{$\mu$}m) in the 20\% PBS phantom, fractional anisotropy (FA) decreased (0.32\textendash 0.26) and mean diffusivity (MD) increased (0.44\,\texttimes\,10-3 mm2/s\textendash 0.70\,\texttimes\,10-3 mm2/s). Similarly, when fiber size increased from 30 to 70\,{$\mu$}m in the 50\% PBS diffusion phantoms, a small change in FA was observed (0.18\textendash 0.22), but MD increased from 0.86\,\texttimes\,10-3 mm2/s to 1.79\,\texttimes\,10-3 mm2/s. This study demonstrates a novel application of tissue engineering to understand complex diffusion signals in skeletal muscle. Through this work, we have also demonstrated the feasibility of 3D printing for skeletal muscle with relevant matrix geometries and physiologically relevant tissue characteristics.},

A range of methods has been used to count glomeruli in kidneys over the past 100~years, with design-based stereology (the physical disector/fractionator combination) considered the gold standard. However, this approach is labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore is not utilized by most laboratories. A new method for counting and sizing every glomerulus in the kidney has recently been described. This method involves in vivo labeling of glomeruli with cationic ferritin, and then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the ex vivo kidney. Values are obtained in one sixth of the time of disector-based approaches. This new MRI method holds great promise for studies of glomerular number and size ex vivo and in vivo.},

However, the influence of chemical processes caused by formalin fixation and differences in temperature may hamper the comparability with results from in vivo MRI. In this study we investigated how formalin fixation and temperature affect T1, T2 and T2* relaxation times of brain tissue. Fixation effects were examined with respect to changes in water content and crosslinking. Relaxometry was performed in brain slices from five deceased subjects at different temperatures. All measurements were repeated after 190 days of formaldehyde immersion. The water content of unfixed and fixed tissue was determined using the wet-to-dry ratio following drying. Protein weight was determined with sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Fixation caused a strong decrease of all relaxation times, the strongest effect being seen on T1, with a reduction of up to 76\%. The temperature coefficient of T1 was lower in the fixed than unfixed tissue, which was in contrast to T2, where an increase of the temperature coefficient was observed following fixation. The reduction of the water content after fixation was in the range of 1\textendash 6\% and thus not sufficient to explain the changes in relaxation time. Results from SDS-PAGE indicated a strong increase of the protein size above 260 kDa in all brain structures examined. Our results suggest that crosslinking induced changes of the macromolecular matrix are responsible for T1 shortening and a decreased temperature dependency. The relaxation times provided in this work should allow optimization of post-mortem MRI protocols for the brain. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Thus there results a component of the nuclear polarization at right angles to both the constant and the r-f field and it is shown that under normal laboratory conditions this component can induce observable voltages.

However, the variability in measured renal blood flow values across studies is large, most likely due to differences in PC-MRI acquisition and processing. Standardized acquisition and processing protocols are therefore needed to minimize this variability and maximize the potential of renal PC-MRI as a clinically useful tool. Purpose To build technical recommendations for the acquisition, processing, and analysis of renal 2D PC-MRI data in human subjects to promote standardization of renal blood flow measurements and facilitate the comparability of results across scanners and in multicenter clinical studies. Study Type Systematic consensus process using a modified Delphi method. Population Not applicable. Sequence Field/Strength Renal fast gradient echo-based 2D PC-MRI. Assessment An international panel of 27 experts from Europe, the USA, Australia, and Japan with 6 (interquartile range 4\textendash 10) years of experience in 2D PC-MRI formulated consensus statements on renal 2D PC-MRI in two rounds of surveys. Starting from a recently published systematic review article, literature-based and data-driven statements regarding patient preparation, hardware, acquisition protocol, analysis steps, and data reporting were formulated. Statistical Tests Consensus was defined as {$\geq$}75\% unanimity in response, and a clear preference was defined as 60\textendash 74\% agreement among the experts. Results Among 60 statements, 57 (95\%) achieved consensus after the second-round survey, while the remaining three showed a clear preference.

In vivo imaging was performed prior to SCI, then again at 2h, 1day, 3days, 7days, and 30days post-SCI using a Bruker 16.4T small animal nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. Cross-sectional spinal cord areas were measured in axial slices and various DTI parameters, i.e. fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity ({$\lambda$}||) and radial diffusivity ({$\lambda\perp$}), were calculated for the total spared white matter (WM), ventral funiculi (VF), lateral funiculi (LF) and dorsal columns (DCs) and then correlated with histopathology. Cross-sectional area measurements revealed significant atrophy (32\% reduction) of the injured spinal cord at the lesion epicentre in the chronic phase of injury. Analysis of diffusion tensor parameters further showed that tissue integrity was most severely affected in the DCs, i.e. the site of immediate impact, which demonstrated a rapid and permanent decrease in FA and {$\lambda$}||. In contrast, DTI parameters for the ventrolateral white matter changed more gradually with time, suggesting that these regions are undergoing more delayed degeneration in a manner that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention. Of all the DTI parameters, {$\lambda\perp$} was most closely correlated to myelin content whereas changes in FA and {$\lambda$}|| appeared more indicative of axonal integrity, Wallerian degeneration and associated presence of macrophages. We conclude that longitudinal DTI at 16.4T provides a clinically relevant, objective measure for assessing white matter pathology following contusive SCI in mice that may aid the translation of putative neuroprotective strategies into the clinic.},

Objective To test the hypothesis that our recently developed non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) T1 mapping sequence could identify myocardial fibrosis without contrast agent. Design, setting and patients A prospective CMR non-contrast T1 mapping study of 109 patients with moderate and severe AS and 33 age- and gender-matched controls. Methods CMR at 1.5 T, including non-contrast T1 mapping using a shortened modified Look\textendash Locker inversion recovery sequence, was carried out. Biopsy samples for histological assessment of collagen volume fraction (CVF\%) were obtained in 19 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. Results There was a significant correlation between T1 values and CVF\% (r=0.65, p=0.002). Mean T1 values were significantly longer in all groups with severe AS (972{$\pm$}33 ms in severe asymptomatic, 1014{$\pm$}38 ms in severe symptomatic) than in normal controls (944{$\pm$}16 ms) (p{$<$}0.05). The strongest associations with T1 values were for aortic valve area (r=-0.40, p=0.001) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (r=0.36, p=0.008), and these were the only independent predictors on multivariate analysis. Conclusions Non-contrast T1 values are increased in patients with severe AS and further increase in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic patients. T1 values lengthened with greater LVMI and correlated with the degree of biopsy-quantified fibrosis. This may provide a useful clinical assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in the future.},

It involves consideration of the fiber-to-field angle for linear structures such as tendons, ligaments, and peripheral nerves, disc-like and circular structures such as menisci and labra, as well as complex three-dimensional structures. There may be one or more fiber types with different orientations within each of these tissues. The orientation of these fibers to B0 is crucial in determining their magic angle effect. Tissues may show a variety of appearances depending on their baseline T2, as well as the increase in T2 produced by the magic angle effect. The appearances are affected by TE, which affects both the general tissue signal level and the change in signal produced by the magic angle effect, fiber-to-slice orientation, and partial volume effects. Deliberate positioning of structures and tissues at particular orientations to B0 can be used to increase the signal from tissues such as tendons and ligaments and so allow them to be imaged with conventional sequences. The technique can also be used to produce contrast between tissues with fibers that have different orientations to B0. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2007. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This technique is able to increase the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images beyond the acquired MRI resolution by incorporating information from whole-brain fibre-tracking results. It not only achieves super-resolution, but also provides very high anatomical contrast with a new MRI contrast mechanism. However, the anatomical information-content of this novel contrast mechanism has not yet been assessed. In this work, we perform such a study using diffusion MRI of ex vivo mouse brains acquired at 16.4T, to compare the results of the super-resolution TDI technique with histological staining (myelin and Nissl stains) in the same brains. Furthermore, a modified version of the directionally-encoded colour TDI map using short-tracks is introduced, which reduces the TDI intensity dynamic range, and therefore enhances the directionality colour-contrast. Good agreement was observed between structures visualised in the super-resolution TDI maps and in the histological sections, supporting the anatomical information-content of the images generated using the TDI technique. The results therefore show that the TDI methodology does provide meaningful and rich anatomical contrast, in addition to achieving super-resolution. Furthermore, this study is the first to show the application of TDI to mouse brain imaging: the high-resolution, high-quality images demonstrate the useful complementary information that can be achieved using super-resolution TDI.},

A comprehensive analysis of the hemodynamics in the thoracic aorta is presented based on the integration of flow-sensitive 4D MRI with state-of-the-art rapid prototyping technology and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Rapid prototyping was used to transform aortic geometries as measured by contrast-enhanced MR angiography into realistic vascular models with large anatomical coverage. Integration into a flow circuit with patient-specific pulsatile in-flow conditions and application of flow-sensitive 4D MRI permitted detailed analysis of local and global 3D flow dynamics in a realistic vascular geometry. Visualization of characteristic 3D flow patterns and quantitative comparisons of the in vitro experiments with in vivo data and CFD simulations in identical vascular geometries were performed to evaluate the accuracy of vascular model systems. The results indicate the potential of such patient-specific model systems for detailed experimental simulation of realistic vascular hemodynamics. Further studies are warranted to examine the influence of refined boundary conditions of the human circulatory system such as fluid-wall interaction and their effect on normal and pathological blood flow characteristics associated with vascular geometry.

This variation employs a combination of pulses of different intensity or duration ("90-degree" and "180-degree" pulses). Measurements of the transverse relaxation time T2 in fluids are often severely compromised by molecular diffusion. Hahn's analysis of the effect of diffusion is reformulated and extended, and a new scheme for measuring T2 is described which, as predicted by the extended theory, largely circumvents the diffusion effect. On the other hand, the free precession technique, applied in a different way, permits a direct measurement of the molecular self-diffusion constant in suitable fluids. A measurement of the self-diffusion constant of water at 25\textdegree C is described which yields D=2.5({$\pm$}0.3)\texttimes 10-5 cm2/sec, in good agreement with previous determinations. An analysis of the effect of convection on free precession is also given. A null method for measuring the longitudinal relaxation time T1, based on the unequal-pulse technique, is described.},

Kidney damage is frequently asymptomatic but is indicated by the presence of proteinuria, hematuria, or reduced GFR. Population-based studies relating to the prevalence of kidney damage in the community are limited, particularly outside of the United States. Therefore, the prevalence of proteinuria, hematuria, and reduced GFR in the Australian adult population was determined using a cross-sectional study of 11,247 noninstitutionalized Australians aged 25 yr or over, randomly selected using a stratified, cluster method. Subjects were interviewed and tested for proteinuria\textemdash spot urine protein to creatinine ratio (abnormal: {$\geq$}0.20 mg/mg); hematuria\textemdash spot urine dipstick (abnormal: 1+ or greater) confirmed by urine microscopy (abnormal: {$>$}10,000 red blood cells per milliliter) or dipstick (abnormal: 1+ or greater) on midstream urine sample; and reduced GFR\textemdash Cockcroft-Gault estimated GFR (abnormal: {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m2). The associations between age, gender, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, and indicators of kidney damage were examined. Proteinuria was detected in 2.4\% of cases (95\% CI: 1.6\%, 3.1\%), hematuria in 4.6\% (95\% CI: 3.8\%, 5.4\%), and reduced GFR in 11.2\% (95\% CI: 8.6\%, 13.8\%). Approximately 16\% had at least one indicator of kidney damage. Age, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were independently associated with proteinuria; age, gender, and hypertension with hematuria; and age, gender, and hypertension with reduced GFR. Approximately 16\% of the Australian adult population has either proteinuria, hematuria, and/or reduced GFR, indicating the presence of kidney damage. Identifying and targeting this section of the population may provide a means to reduce the burden of ESRD. E-mail: bob.atkins@med.monash. edu.au},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The effects of k-space sampling and signal decay on the effective spatial resolution of MRI and functional MRI (fMRI) are commonly assessed by means of the magnitude point-spread function (PSF), defined as the absolute values (magnitudes) of the complex MR imaging PSF. It is commonly assumed that this magnitude PSF signifies blurring, which can be quantified by its full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). Here we show that the magnitude PSF fails to accurately represent the true effects of k-space sampling and signal decay.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Firstly, a substantial part of the width of the magnitude PSF is due to MRI sampling per se. This part is independent of any signal decay and its effect depends on the spatial frequency composition of the imaged object. Therefore, it cannot always be expected to introduce blurring. Secondly, MRI reconstruction is typically followed by taking the absolute values (magnitude image) of the reconstructed complex image. This introduces a non-linear stage into the process of image formation. The \emph{complex} imaging PSF does not fully describe this process, since it does not reflect the stage of taking the magnitude image. Its corresponding \emph{magnitude} PSF fails to correctly describe this process, since convolving the original pattern with the magnitude PSF is different from the true process of taking the absolute following a convolution with the complex imaging PSF. Lastly, signal decay can have not only a blurring, but also a high-pass filtering effect. This cannot be reflected by the strictly positive width of the magnitude PSF.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}As an alternative, we propose to first approximate the MRI process linearly. We then model the linear approximation by decomposing it into a signal decay-independent MR sampling part and an approximation of the signal decay effect. We approximate the latter as a convolution with a Gaussian PSF or, if the effect is that of high-pass filtering, as reversing the effect of a convolution with a Gaussian PSF. We show that for typical high-resolution fMRI at 7 Tesla, signal decay in Spin-Echo has a moderate blurring effect (FWHM = 0.89 voxels, corresponds to 0.44 mm for 0.5 mm wide voxels). In contrast, Gradient-Echo acts as a moderate high-pass filter that can be interpreted as reversing a Gaussian blurring with FWHM = 0.59 voxels (0.30 mm for 0.5 mm wide voxels). Our improved approximations and findings hold not only for Gradient-Echo and Spin-Echo fMRI but also for GRASE and VASO fMRI. Our findings support the correct planning, interpretation, and modeling of high-resolution fMRI.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to image the kidneys without any contrast media. FA of the medulla has been shown to correlate with kidney function. It is expected that higher spatial resolution would improve the depiction of small structures within the kidney. However, the achievement of high spatial resolution in renal DTI remains challenging as a result of respiratory motion and susceptibility to diffusion imaging artefacts. In this study, a targeted field of view (TFOV) method was used to obtain high-resolution FA maps and colour-coded diffusion tensor orientations, together with measures of the medullary and cortical FA, in 12 healthy subjects. Subjects were scanned with two implementations (dual and single kidney) of a TFOV DTI method. DTI scans were performed during free breathing with a navigator-triggered sequence. Results showed high consistency in the greyscale FA, colour-coded FA and diffusion tensors across subjects and between dual- and single-kidney scans, which have in-plane voxel sizes of 2\,\texttimes\,2\,mm2 and 1.2\,\texttimes\,1.2\,mm2, respectively. The ability to acquire multiple contiguous slices allowed the medulla and cortical FA to be quantified over the entire kidney volume. The mean medulla and cortical FA values were 0.38\,{$\pm$}\,0.017 and 0.21\,{$\pm$}\,0.019, respectively, for the dual-kidney scan, and 0.35\,{$\pm$}\,0.032 and 0.20\,{$\pm$}\,0.014, respectively, for the single-kidney scan. The mean FA between the medulla and cortex was significantly different (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) for both dual- and single-kidney implementations. High-spatial-resolution DTI shows promise for improving the characterization and non-invasive assessment of kidney function. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.

The association between baseline htTKV and the attainment of stage 3 CKD (GFR {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) during follow-up was determined. Results After a mean follow-up of 7.9 years, stage 3 CKD was attained in 30.7\% of the enrollees. Using baseline htTKV, negative correlations with GFR increased from -0.22 at baseline to -0.65 at year 8. In multivariable analysis, a baseline htTKV increase of 100 cc/m significantly predicted the development of CKD within 8 years with an odds ratio of 1.48 (95\% confidence interval: 1.29, 1.70). In receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, baseline htTKV of 600 cc/m most accurately defined the risk of developing stage 3 CKD within 8 years with an area under the curve of 0.84 (95\% confidence interval: 0.79, 0.90). htTKV was a better predictor than baseline age, serum creatinine, BUN, urinary albumin, or monocyte chemotactic protein-1 excretion (P{$<$}0.05). Conclusions Baseline htTKV {$\geq$}600 cc/m predicted the risk of developing renal insufficiency in ADPKD patients at high risk for renal disease progression within 8 years of follow-up, qualifying htTKV as a prognostic biomarker in ADPKD.},

  abstract = {Renal structure in early autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD): The Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) cohort Background Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by gradual renal enlargement and cyst growth prior to loss of renal function. Standard radiographic imaging has not provided the resolution and accuracy necessary to detect small changes in renal volume or to reliably measure renal cyst volumes. The Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies in Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) is longitudinally observing ADPKD individuals using high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to determine if change in renal and cyst volumes can be detected over a short period of time, and if they correlate with decline in renal function early in disease. Methods Standardization studies were conducted in phantoms and four subjects at each participating clinical center. After, in the full-scale protocol, healthy ADPKD individuals 15 to 45years old with creatinine clearance{$>$}70mL/min underwent standardized MR renal imaging, renal iothalamate clearance, comprehensive clinical evaluation, and determination of 24-hour urinary albumin and electrolyte excretion. Stereology was used from T1-weighted images to quantify renal volume, and region-growing thresholding was used from T2-weighted images to determine cyst volume. Renal structures were evaluated in relation to demographic, clinical, and biochemical variables using means/medians, standard deviations, and Pearson correlations. Results Reliability coefficients for MR renal and cyst volume measurements in phantoms were 99.9\% and 89.2\%, respectively. In the full-scale protocol, 241 ADPKD individuals (145 women and 96 men) were enrolled. Total renal, cyst, and \% cyst volume were significantly greater in each decade group. Hypertensive individuals demonstrated greater renal, cyst, and \% cyst volume than normotensive subjects. Age-adjusted renal (r = -0.31, P {$<$} 0.0001), cyst (r = -0.36, P {$<$} 0.0001), and \% cyst volume (r = -0.35, P {$<$} 0.0001) were inversely related to glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Age-adjusted renal volume (r = 0.42, P {$<$} 0.0001), cystic (r = 0.39, P {$<$} 0.0001, and \% cyst volume (r = 0.41, P {$<$} 0.0001) were related with urinary albumin excretion. Conclusion MR measures of renal and cyst volume are reliable and accurate in patients with ADPKD. ADPKD is characterized by significant cystic involvement that increases with age. Structure (renal and cyst volume) and function (GFR) are inversely related and directly related with the presence of hypertension and urinary albumin excretion in individuals with normal renal function.},

Renal T2* is sensitive to dephasing due to background magnetic field gradients, the degree of which differs across the MR vendors. A strong B0 L-R gradient, especially prominent for one vendor, leads to an asymmetry in T2* values between kidneys. B1 maps vary across subjects with no vendor-specific bias. Renal cortex T1 values computed using a 2-parameter fit were shown to systematically vary across vendors; a 3-parameter fit reduced this bias but differences remain. This highlights areas of future development for standardisation.},

  abstract = {Purpose To develop a super-resolution technique using convolutional neural networks for generating thin-slice knee MR images from thicker input slices, and compare this method with alternative through-plane interpolation methods. Methods We implemented a 3D convolutional neural network entitled DeepResolve to learn residual-based transformations between high-resolution thin-slice images and lower-resolution thick-slice images at the same center locations. DeepResolve was trained using 124 double echo in steady-state (DESS) data sets with 0.7-mm slice thickness and tested on 17 patients. Ground-truth images were compared with DeepResolve, clinically used tricubic interpolation, and Fourier interpolation methods, along with state-of-the-art single-image sparse-coding super-resolution. Comparisons were performed using structural similarity, peak SNR, and RMS error image quality metrics for a multitude of thin-slice downsampling factors. Two musculoskeletal radiologists ranked the 3 data sets and reviewed the diagnostic quality of the DeepResolve, tricubic interpolation, and ground-truth images for sharpness, contrast, artifacts, SNR, and overall diagnostic quality. Mann-Whitney U tests evaluated differences among the quantitative image metrics, reader scores, and rankings. Cohen's Kappa ({$\kappa$}) evaluated interreader reliability. Results DeepResolve had significantly better structural similarity, peak SNR, and RMS error than tricubic interpolation, Fourier interpolation, and sparse-coding super-resolution for all downsampling factors (p {$<$} .05, except 4 \texttimes{} and 8 \texttimes{} sparse-coding super-resolution downsampling factors). In the reader study, DeepResolve significantly outperformed (p {$<$} .01) tricubic interpolation in all image quality categories and overall image ranking. Both readers had substantial scoring agreement ({$\kappa$} = 0.73). Conclusion DeepResolve was capable of resolving high-resolution thin-slice knee MRI from lower-resolution thicker slices, achieving superior quantitative and qualitative diagnostic performance to both conventionally used and state-of-the-art methods.},

The volumes of five excised porcine kidneys were measured by (1) disc-summation method, (2) ellipsoid formula, and (3) water displacement method. In a retrospective, consecutive group of clinically referred patients (n = 150; 300 kidneys), individual kidney volume and length were calculated by the disc-summation method and by multiplanar reformation of MRI data, respectively. For comparison, kidney volumes also were calculated using the ellipsoid formula in all patients. Renal volume that was obtained by MRI using the disc-summation method was within 5\% of the volume that was determined by the water displacement method, independent of the spatial resolution of the MRI technique used. Data from both the in vivo and the ex vivo models revealed that the ellipsoid formula that commonly is used in ultrasonography underestimates renal volume by 17 to 29\% compared with the disc-summation method (P {$<$} 0.05). As measured by MRI (mean {$\pm$} SD), kidney lengths were 12.4 {$\pm$} 0.9 cm for men and 11.6 {$\pm$} 1.1 cm for women, and kidney volumes were 202 {$\pm$} 36 ml for men and 154 {$\pm$} 33 ml for women. The results from the ex vivo MRI study show that the kidney volume that was obtained using the disc-summation method is within 5\% of the true kidney volume as measured by the water displacement method. The ellipsoid formula consistently and significantly underestimates the true kidney volume. The length and the volume of kidneys that are obtained by MRI in patients with no known history of intrinsic renal disease are greater than the commonly quoted reference values that are obtained by ultrasonography.},

Theory and Methods 3D multi-echo gradient echo imaging and perfusion imaging with arterial spin labeling were performed in 11 healthy subjects. CMRO2 and OEF maps were reconstructed by joint quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to process GRE phases and quantitative blood oxygen level-dependent (qBOLD) modeling to process GRE magnitudes. Comparisons with QSM and qBOLD alone were performed using ROI analysis, paired t-tests, and Bland-Altman plot. Results The average CMRO2 value in cortical gray matter across subjects were 140.4 {$\pm$} 14.9, 134.1 {$\pm$} 12.5, and 184.6 {$\pm$} 17.9 {$\mu$}mol/100 g/min, with corresponding OEFs of 30.9 {$\pm$} 3.4\%, 30.0 {$\pm$} 1.8\%, and 40.9 {$\pm$} 2.4\% for methods based on QSM, qBOLD, and QSM+qBOLD, respectively. QSM+qBOLD provided the highest CMRO2 contrast between gray and white matter, more uniform OEF than QSM, and less noisy OEF than qBOLD.

The method was validated with the blinded use of saline solutions of varying sodium concentrations. [Na] was measured in the calf muscles in 10 healthy volunteers. 23Na MR imaging also was performed in two healthy subjects after exercise, two patients with myotonic dystrophy, and two patients with osteoarthritis. RESULTS:23Na MR imaging yielded a total [Na] value of 28.4 mmol/kg of wet weight~{$\pm~$}3.6 (SD) in normal muscle, consistent with prior biopsy data. Spatial resolution was 0.22 mL, with signal-to-noise ratio of 10\textendash 15. Mean signal intensity elevations were 16\% and 22\% after exercise and 47\% and 70\% in dystrophic muscles compared with those at normal resting levels. In osteoarthritis, mean signal intensity reductions were 36\% and 15\% compared with those in unaffected knee joints. CONCLUSION:23Na MR imaging can be used to quantify total [Na] in human muscle.

The T2-mapping protocol was optimized using simulations and evaluated with phantoms. Results Repeatability for determination of myocardial T2 values was assessed in vivo in n = 5 healthy mice on 2 different days. The average baseline T2 of the left ventricular myocardium was 22.5 {$\pm$} 1.7 ms. The repeatability coefficient for R2 = 1/T2 for measurements at different days was {$\Delta$}R2 = 6.3 s-1. Subsequently, T2 mapping was applied in comparison to late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) imaging, to assess 1-day-old ischemia/reperfusion (IR) myocardial injury in n = 8 mice. T2 in the infarcts was significantly higher than in remote tissue, whereas remote tissue was not significantly different from baseline. Infarct sizes based on T2 versus LGE showed strong correlation. To assess the time-course of T2 changes in the infarcts, T2 mapping was performed at day 1, 3, and 7 after IR injury in a separate group of mice (n = 16). T2 was highest at day 3, in agreement with the expected time course of edema formation and resolution after myocardial infarction.

METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 15,625 noninstitutionalized adults aged 20 years and older from the NHANES III was analyzed. Kidney function (GFR), kidney damage (albuminuria), and stages of CKD (GFR and albuminuria) were estimated from calibrated serum creatinine level, spot urine albumin level, age, sex, and race. GFR was estimated using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation and compared with the Cockcroft-Gault equation for creatinine clearance (CCr). RESULTS: The prevalence of CKD in the US adult population was 11\% (19.2 million). By stage, an estimated 5.9 million individuals (3.3\%) had stage 1 (persistent albuminuria with a normal GFR), 5.3 million (3.0\%) had stage 2 (persistent albuminuria with a GFR of 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), 7.6 million (4.3\%) had stage 3 (GFR, 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), 400,000 individuals (0.2\%) had stage 4 (GFR, 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), and 300,000 individuals (0.2\%) had stage 5, or kidney failure. Aside from hypertension and diabetes, age is a key predictor of CKD, and 11\% of individuals older than 65 years without hypertension or diabetes had stage 3 or worse CKD. Compared with GFR estimates, CCr estimates showed a steeper decline with age and were lower in non-Hispanic blacks. CONCLUSION: CKD is common and warrants improved detection and classification using standardized criteria to improve outcomes. Am J Kidney Dis 41:1-12.},

Histogram analysis for the IR SE-EPI T1 map allows differential regions within the medulla to be separated.},

  abstract = {Background: This paper outlines a multiparametric renal MRI acquisition and analysis protocol to allow non-invasive assessment of haemodynamics (renal artery blood flow and perfusion), oxygenation (BOLD T2*) and microstructure (diffusion, T1 mapping). Methods: We use our multiparametric renal MRI protocol to provide 1) a comprehensive set of MRI parameters (renal artery and vein blood flow, perfusion, T1, T2*, diffusion (ADC, D, D*, fp) and total kidney volume) in a large cohort of healthy participants (127 participants with mean age of 41 {$\pm$} 19 years) and show the MR field strength (1.5 T versus 3 T) dependence of T1 and T2* relaxation times; 2) the repeatability of multiparametric MRI measures in eleven healthy participants; 3) changes in MRI measures in response to hypercapnic and hyperoxic modulations in six healthy participants; and 4) pilot data showing the application of the multiparametric protocol in eleven patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Results: Baseline measures were in-line with literature values, and as expected, T1 values were longer at 3 T compared with 1.5 T, with increased T1 corticomedullary differentiation at 3 T. Conversely, T2* was longer at 1.5 T. Inter-scan coefficients of variation (CoVs) of T1 mapping and ADC were very good at {$<$}2.9 \%. Intra class correlations (ICCs) were high for cortex perfusion (0.801), cortex and medulla T1 (0.848 and 0.997 using SE-EPI), and renal artery flow (0.844). In response to hypercapnia, a decrease in cortex T2* was observed, whilst no significant effect of hyperoxia on T2* was found. In CKD patients, renal artery and vein blood flow, and renal perfusion was lower than for healthy participants. Renal cortex and medulla T1 was significantly higher in CKD patients compared to healthy participants, with corticomedullary T1 differentiation reduced in CKD patients compared to healthy participants. No significant difference was found in renal T2*. Conclusions: Multiparametric MRI is a powerful technique for the assessment of changes in structure, haemodynamics and oxygenation in a single scan session. This protocol provides the potential to assess the pathophysiological mechanisms in various aetiologies of renal disease, and to assess the efficacy of drug treatments.},

  abstract = {In this thesis methods of accurately and reproducibly measuring intestinal content and transverse relaxation to study the fate of food in the gastrointestinal tract are reported. In addition to this a technique for measuring relaxation parameters in the brain at ultra-high field is also investigated. Several methods can be used when quantifying the fate of food through the gastrointestinal tract; there are many factors that can be measured using MRI and these are discussed along with other non-MRI techniques. In this work a method for quantifying small bowel water content (SBWC) is optimised and validated for use at 3.0 T and a technique for measuring T2 in the abdomen is developed and optimised called T2-prepared balanced turbo field echo (T2-prep bTFE). These two methods are then used, in conjunction with other established MRI techniques, to study the fate of food in the gastrointestinal tract from the stomach all the way through to the colon. A hybrid gradient echo-spin echo (GESSE) sequence is also investigated and optimised for measuring T2 and T2* simultaneously in the brain at 7.0 T. This sequence is also proved to have applications in the liver at lower field strengths. The GESSE sequence is used to measure the first T2 values in deep grey structures in the brain at 7.0 T. In this work cross-field (1.5, 3.0 and 7.0 T) variations in T2 are studied. Also differences in T2 and T2* are measured in the brain to determine variations between white matter tracts and to ascertain any effects of Parkinson's disease on deep grey matter structures.},

This is a hypothesis-generating pilot study assessing the effect of nephrectomy on renal function in healthy kidney donors.MethodsEight living kidney donors underwent arterial spin labelling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and GFR measurement prior to and 1 year after nephrectomy. Chromium-51 labelled ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA) with multi-blood sampling was undertaken and GFR calculated. The RBF and GFR obtained were used to calculate FF.ResultsAll donors showed an increase in single kidney GFR of 24 \textendash{} 75 \%, and all but two showed an increase in FF (-7 to +52 \%) after nephrectomy. The increase in RBF, and hence RPF, post-nephrectomy was not as great as the increase in GFR in seven out of eight donors. As with any pilot study, the small number of donors and their relatively narrow age range are potential limiting factors.ConclusionsThe ability to measure RBF, and hence RPF, non-invasively, coupled with GFR measurement, allows calculation of FF, a biomarker that might provide a sensitive indicator of loss of renal reserve in potential donors.Key Points\textbullet{} Non-invasive MRI measured renal blood flow and calculated renal plasma flow. \textbullet{} Effect of nephrectomy on blood flow and filtration in donors is presented. \textbullet{} Calculated filtration fraction may be a useful new kidney biomarker.},

Here we describe a set of automated procedures for obtaining accurate reconstructions of the cortical surface, which have been applied to data from more than 100 subjects, requiring little or no manual intervention. Automated routines for unfolding and flattening the cortical surface are described in a companion paper.

We developed a fully automated method to segment the kidneys from T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) to calculate TKV of healthy control (HC) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods: This automated method uses machine learning, specifically a 2-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural network (CNN), to accurately segment the left and right kidneys from T2-weighted MRI data. The dataset consisted of 30 HC subjects and 30 CKD patients. The model was trained on 50 manually defined HC and CKD kidney segmentations. The model was subsequently evaluated on 50 test data sets, comprising data from five HCs and five CKD patients each scanned five times in a scan session to enable comparison of the precision of the CNN and manual segmentation of kidneys. Results: The unseen test data processed by the 2D CNN had a mean Dice score of 0.93 {$\pm$} 0.01. The difference between manual and automatically computed TKV was 1.2 {$\pm$} 16.2 ml with a mean surface distance of 0.65 {$\pm$} 0.21 mm. The variance in TKV measurements from repeat acquisitions on the same subject was significantly lower using the automated method compared to manual segmentation of the kidneys. Conclusion: The 2D CNN method provides fully automated segmentation of the left and right kidney and calculation of TKV in under ten seconds on a standard office computer, allowing high data throughput and is a freely available executable.},

In these studies we can modify the tissue relaxation properties of the fixed tissues to better suite the scanner hardware. We investigated the use of Gd-DTPA contrast agent to provide the optimum signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in 3D DTI scans of formalin fixed nonhuman primate brains at 4.7~T. Relaxivity measurements in gray and white matter allowed us to optimize the Gd concentration for soaking the brains, resulting in a 2 fold improvement in SNR for the 3D scans. FA changed little with Gd concentrations up to 10~mM although ADC was reduced at 5 and 10~mM. Comparison of in vivo, fresh ex vivo and fixed brains showed no significant FA changes but reductions in ADC of about 50\% in fresh ex vivo, and 64\% and 80\% in fixed gray and white matter respectively. Studies of the temperature dependence of diffusion in these tissues suggested that a 30\textdegree{} increase in sample temperature may yield an improvement of up to 55\% in SNR-efficiency for a given diffusion weighting. Our Gd soaking regimen appeared to have no detrimental effect on standard histology of the fixed brain sections. Our methods yield both high SNR and spatial resolution DTI data in fixed primate brains, allowing us to perform high resolution tractography which will facilitate the process of `validation' of DTI fiber tracts against traditional measures of brain fiber architecture.},

  abstract = {Unlike in vivo imaging, postmortem MRI allows for invasive examination of the tissue specimen immediately after the MR scan. However, natural tissue decomposition and chemical fixation cause the postmortem tissue's MRI properties to be different from those found in vivo. Moreover, these properties change as postmortem fixation time elapses. The goal of this study was to characterize the T2 relaxation changes that occur over time in cadaveric human brain hemispheres during fixation. Five hemispheres immersed in formaldehyde solution were scanned on a weekly basis for 3 months postmortem, and once again at 6 months postmortem. The T2 relaxation times were measured throughout the hemispheres. Over time, T2 values near the edges of the hemispheres decreased rapidly after death, while T2 values of deep tissue decreased more slowly. This difference is likely due to the relatively large distance from the hemisphere surface, and other barriers limiting diffusion of formaldehyde molecules to deep tissues. In addition, T2 values in deep tissue did not continuously decay to a plateau, but instead reached a minimum and then increased to a plateau. This final increase may be due to the effects of prolonged tissue decomposition, a hypothesis that is supported by numerical simulations of the fixation process.

Six images were acquired during one breath hold with a half-Fourier acquisition single-shot fast SE sequence. Signal intensities in regions of interest were fit to theoretical curves. Measurements were performed at 1.5 and 3.0 T. Relaxation times at 1.5 T were compared with those reported in the literature by using a one-sample t test. Differences in mean relaxation time between 1.5 and 3.0 T were analyzed with a two-sample paired t test.RESULTS: Relaxation times (mean {$\pm$} SD) at 3.0 T are reported for kidney cortex (T1, 1,142 msec {$\pm$} 154; T2, 76 msec {$\pm$} 7), kidney medulla (T1, 1,545 msec {$\pm$} 142; T2, 81 msec {$\pm$} 8), liver (T1, 809 msec {$\pm$} 71; T2, 34 msec {$\pm$} 4), spleen (T1, 1,328 msec {$\pm$} 31; T2, 61 msec {$\pm$} 9), pancreas (T1, 725 msec {$\pm$} 71; T2, 43 msec {$\pm$} 7), paravertebral muscle (T1, 898 msec {$\pm$} 33; T2, 29 msec {$\pm$} 4), bone marrow in L4 vertebra (T1, 586 msec {$\pm$} 73; T2, 49 msec {$\pm$} 4), subcutaneous fat (T1, 382 msec {$\pm$} 13; T2, 68 msec {$\pm$} 4), prostate (T1, 1,597 msec {$\pm$} 42; T2, 74 msec {$\pm$} 9), myometrium (T1, 1,514 msec {$\pm$} 156; T2, 79 msec {$\pm$} 10), endometrium (T1, 1,453 msec {$\pm$} 123; T2, 59 msec {$\pm$} 1), and cervix (T1, 1,616 msec {$\pm$} 61; T2, 83 msec {$\pm$} 7). On average, T1 relaxation times were 21\% longer (P {$<$} .05) for kidney cortex, liver, and spleen and T2 relaxation times were 8\% shorter (P {$<$} .05) for liver, spleen, and fat at 3.0 T; however, the fractional change in T1 and T2 relaxation times varied greatly with the organ. At 1.5 T, no significant differences (P {$>$} .05) in T1 relaxation time between the results of this study and the results of other studies for liver, kidney, spleen, and muscle tissue were found.CONCLUSION: T1 relaxation times are generally higher and T2 relaxation times are generally lower at 3.0 T than at 1.5 T, but the magnitude of change varies greatly in different tissues.\textcopyright{} RSNA, 2004},

Statistical Test To assess the repeatability, a Bland\textendash Altman analysis was performed and coefficients of variation (CoVs), repeatability coefficients, and intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated. Results CoVs for relaxometry (T1, T2, R2*/BOLD) were below 6.1\%, with the lowest CoVs for T2 maps and highest for R2*/BOLD. CoVs for all diffusion analyses were below 7.2\%, except for perfusion fraction (FP), with CoVs ranging from 18\textendash 24\%. The CoV for renal sinus fat volume and percentage were both around 9\%. Perfusion measurements were most repeatable with ASL (cortical perfusion only) and 2D phase contrast with CoVs of 10\% and 13\%, respectively. DCE perfusion had a CoV of 16\%, while single kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) had a CoV of 13\%.

  abstract = {Measurements of the transverse relaxation time T2 are usually conducted with the Carr Purcell Meiboom Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence, which causes T2-weighted magnetization. Diffusion effects are a common source of error in measurements of this kind, because the incoherent motion of spins in external magnetic field gradients distorts T2 weighting of the transverse magnetization. As a result, inaccurate T2-values are obtained. In this work, we present a method which completely compensates for the effect of diffusion.},

Pixel-wise mapping of T1 and T2 image sequences enable direct quantification of T1, T2(*), and extracellular volume values of the target organ of interest. Tissue characterization based on T1 and T2(*) mapping is currently making the transition from a research tool to a clinical modality, as clinical usefulness has been established for several diseases such as myocarditis, amyloidosis, Anderson-Fabry and iron deposition. Other potential clinical applications besides the heart include, quantification of steatosis, cirrhosis, hepatic siderosis and renal fibrosis. Here, we provide an overview of potential clinical applications of T1 andT2(*) mapping for imaging of cardiac, liver and renal disease. Furthermore, we give an overview of important technical considerations necessary for clinical implementation of quantitative parametric imaging, involving data acquisition, data analysis, quality assessment, and interpretation. In order to achieve clinical implementation of these techniques, standardization of T1 and T2(*) mapping methodology and validation of impact on clinical decision making is needed.},

A multidisciplinary panel consisting of 18 experts in the field of renal T1 and T2 mapping participated in a consensus project, which was initiated by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology Action PARENCHIMA CA16103. Consensus recommendations were formulated using a two-step modified Delphi method. The first survey consisted of 56 items on T1 mapping, of which 4 reached the pre-defined consensus threshold of 75\% or higher. The second survey was expanded to include both T1 and T2 mapping, and consisted of 54 items of which 32 reached consensus. Recommendations based were formulated on hardware, patient preparation, acquisition, analysis and reporting. Consensus-based technical recommendations for renal T1 and T2 mapping were formulated. However, there was considerable lack of consensus for renal T1 and particularly renal T2 mapping, to some extent surprising considering the long history of relaxometry in MRI, highlighting key knowledge gaps that require further work. This paper should be regarded as a first step in a long-term evidence-based iterative process towards ever increasing harmonization of scan protocols across sites, to ultimately facilitate clinical implementation.},

  abstract = {BackgroundUreteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction is a common cause of renal injury in children. Indications for surgery are still controversial. Currently, there is no threshold to differentiate patients with suspected UPJ obstruction requiring surgery from the ones that do not, or to predict renal outcome after surgery. Several studies have demonstrated that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) results may correlate with microstructural changes in the kidneys.ObjectiveTo evaluate the feasibility of using DTI to identify UPJ obstruction kidneys.Materials and methodsWe analyzed functional MR urography (fMRU) with renal DTI (b=0 and b=400, 20 directions, 1.5 Tesla, no respiratory triggering) in 26 kidneys of 19 children (mean age: 6.15 years) by comparing 13 kidneys with UPJ obstruction configuration that underwent pyeloplasty following the fMRU, and 13 anatomically normal age- and gender-matched kidneys. DTI tractography was reconstructed using a fractional anisotropy threshold of 0.10 and an angle threshold of 55\textdegree. User-defined regions of interest (ROIs) of the renal parenchyma (excluding collecting system) were drawn to quantify DTI parameters: fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), track length and track volume. The failure rate was evaluated.ResultsAll DTI parameters changed with age; fractional anisotropy decreased (P{$<$}0.032). Track volume and track length increased (P{$<$}0.05). ADC increased with age in normal kidneys (P{$<$}0.001) but not in UPJ obstruction kidneys (P=0.11). After controlling for age, the fractional anisotropy (UPJ obstruction mean: 0.18, normal kidney mean: 0.21; P=0.001) and track length (UPJ obstruction mean: 11.9 mm, normal kidney mean: 15.4 mm; P{$<$}0.001) were lower in UPJ obstruction vs. normal kidneys. There was a trend toward a higher ADC in UPJ obstruction kidneys vs. normal kidneys (P=0.062). The failure rate in UPJ obstruction kidneys due to technical limitations of DTI was 13/26 (50\%).ConclusionWe demonstrated that fractional anisotropy is lower in UPJ obstruction than in normal kidneys. It is necessary to improve this technique to increase the success rate and to perform more studies to evaluate if a decrease in fractional anisotropy can differentiate UPJ obstruction kidneys from hydronephrotic kidneys without UPJ obstruction.},

  abstract = {Objective Since renal volume is to be considered in managing renal diseases, a reproducible technique is needed. Our aim was to estimate intraobserver, interobserver, and interstudy reproducibility of renal volume measurement in subjects without known kidney disease using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and methods We studied 20 patients (age range 33\textendash 82 years) without known renal disease using 1.5-T MR imaging with a respiratory-gated two-dimensional coronal balanced steady state free precession sequence. Each patient repeated the study after 1h. Two readers independently segmented the area of both kidneys of the first study, subtracting cysts. After 1 week, the first reader segmented the second study and repeated the segmentation of the first study. The volume of each kidney was obtained by multiplying the renal area on each slice by the slice thickness and summing all the partial volumes. Reproducibility was assessed by Bland-Altman and Wilcoxon statistics. The coefficient of repeatability (CoR) was summed to the absolute value of bias; the ratio between this sum and the mean of the two data sets was used as a measure of variability while its complement to 100\% was used as a measure of reproducibility. Results Acquisition time was 2\textendash 3min. Segmentation time was 20\textendash 25min. Intraobserver variability results in a CoR of 7ml and in a reproducibility of 95\%, interobserver variability 8.8\textendash 9.8ml and 87\textendash 88\%, interstudy variability 9.8\textendash 10.6ml and 91\textendash 93\%, respectively. Considering both the effect of observer and the repetition of the study, the reproducibility was 83\textendash 87\%. Conclusion Renal volume measurement by MR imaging is highly reproducible.},

In 25 patients who had received diuretics for 2-14 years the mean concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and sodium-potassium pumps were measured in skeletal muscle biopsy specimens and were significantly lower than in those from a group of age matched controls. The reductions in all three variables were significant in those patients receiving diuretics for arterial hypertension as well as in those being treated for congestive heart failure. In 14 patients the mean muscle potassium concentration was below the control range, but only one of those was hypokalaemic (3{$\cdot$}4 mmol/l), and 13 were receiving potassium supplements. In 15 patients the mean muscle magnesium concentration was below normal, and the mean muscle potassium and magnesium concentrations showed a linear correlation. In 12 patients in whom the mean muscle potassium concentration was below 80 {$\mu$}mol/g wet weight there was a linear correlation between the cellular potassium:sodium ratio and the concentration of 3H-ouabain binding sites indicating that potassium deficiency also leads to a down regulation of sodium-potassium pumps in human skeletal muscle., In spite of potassium supplements long term treatment with diuretics may lead to potassium and magnesium deficiencies, which are not detectable using the standard methods of serum analysis. The changes in concentrations of electrolytes and sodium-potassium pumps associated with treatment with diuretics may impair muscle function and potassium homoeostasis and interfere with the distribution of digitalis glycosides.},

Follow-up was for a mean of 5.5 years for survival, cause of death, and acceptance to renal replacement therapy (RRT). The annual incidence rate of detected CKD was 1,701 per million population (pmp; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1,613 to 1,793) and 1,071 pmp (95\% CI, 1,001 to 1,147) in those younger than 80 years. There was a steep age gradient; median age was 77 years. The man-woman rate ratio was 1.6 (95\% CI, 1.4 to 1.8), with a male excess in all age groups older than 40 years. Incidence increased in areas with greater socioeconomic deprivation. Median survival was 35 months. Age, SCr level, and deprivation index were all significantly associated with survival. Standardized mortality ratios were 36-fold in those aged 16 to 49 years, 12-fold in those aged 50 to 64 years, and more than 2-fold in those older than 65 years. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was the most common cause of death (46\%). Only 4\% of patients were accepted to RRT. The incidence of diagnosed CKD is common, especially in the elderly, and is greater in more deprived areas. Prognosis is poor, with CVD prominent. More research is needed to assess the effectiveness and costs of increasing referral to nephrologists of patients with CKD.},

It is also useful for fMRI studies to assess the stimulus-induced changes in Yv, particularly since basal Yv partially accounts for inter-subject variation in the haemodynamic response to a stimulus. A range of MRI-based methods of measuring Yv have been developed recently. Here, we use a method based on the change in phase in the MR image arising from the field perturbation caused by deoxygenated haemoglobin in veins. We build on the existing phase based approach (Method I), where Yv is measured in a large vein (such as the superior sagittal sinus) based on the field shift inside the vein with assumptions as to the vein's shape and orientation. We demonstrate two novel modifications which address limitations of this method. The first modification (Method II), maps the actual form of the vein, rather than assume a given shape and orientation. The second modification (Method III) uses the intra and perivascular phase change in response to a known change in Yv on hyperoxia to measure normoxic Yv in smaller veins. Method III can be applied to veins whose shape, size and orientation are not accurately known, thus allowing more localised measures of venous oxygenation. Results demonstrate that the use of an overly fine spatial filter caused an overestimation in Yv for Method I, whilst the measurement of Yv using Method II was less sensitive to this bias, giving Yv = 0.62 {$\pm$} 0.03. Method III was applied to mapping of Yv in local veins across the brain, yielding a distribution of values with a mode of Yv = 0.661 {$\pm$} 0.008.},

Methods: The recipe includes deionized water as the solvent, NaCl to primarily control conductivity, sucrose to primarily control permittivity, agar\textendash agar to gel the solution and reduce heat diffusivity, and benzoic acid to preserve the gel. Two hundred and seventeen samples were prepared to cover the feasible range of NaCl and sucrose concentrations. Their dielectric properties were measured using a commercial dielectric probe and were fitted to a 3D polynomial to generate a recipe describing the properties as a function of NaCl concentration, sucrose concentration, and frequency. Results: Results indicated that the intuitive linear and independent relationships between NaCl and conductivity and between sucrose and permittivity are not valid. A generic polynomial recipe was developed to characterize the complex relationship between the solutes and the resulting dielectric values and has been made publicly available as a web application. In representative mixtures developed to mimic brain and muscle tissue, less than 2\% difference was observed between the predicted and measured conductivity and permittivity values. Conclusions: It is expected that the recipe will be useful for generating dielectric phantoms for general magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coil development at high magnetic field strength, including coil safety evaluation as well as pulse sequence evaluation (including B1+ mapping, B1+ shimming, and selective excitation pulse design), and other non-MRI applications which require biologically equivalent dielectric properties.},

To investigate this, our study evaluated the impact of 5 widely used media on: (1) image quality, (2) contrast of high spatial resolution gradient-echo (T1 and T2*-weighted) MR images, (3) effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*), and (4) quantitative susceptibility measurements (QSM) of post-mortem brain specimens. Methods Five formaldehyde-fixed brain slices were scanned using 7.0T MRI in: (1) formaldehyde solution (formalin), (2) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), (3) deuterium oxide (D2O), (4) perfluoropolyether (Galden), and (5) agarose gel. SNR and contrast-to-noise ratii (SNR/CNR) were calculated for cortex/white matter (WM) and basal ganglia/WM regions. In addition, median R2* and QSM values were extracted from caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, WM, and cortical regions. Results PBS, Galden, and agarose returned higher SNR/CNR compared to formalin and D2O. Formalin fixation, and its use as embedding medium for scanning, increased tissue R2*. Imaging with agarose, D2O, and Galden returned lower R2* values than PBS (and formalin). No major QSM offsets were observed, although spatial variance was increased (with respect to R2* behaviors) for formalin and agarose. Conclusions Embedding media affect gradient-echo image quality, R2*, and QSM in differing ways. In this study, PBS embedding was identified as the most stable experimental setup, although by a small margin. Agarose and Galden were preferred to formalin or D2O embedding. Formalin significantly increased R2* causing noisier data and increased QSM variance.},

The main purpose of this study was to determine baseline values of such parameters in healthy volunteers. In 28 healthy volunteers (15 women and 13 men), arterial spin labeling to estimate regional renal perfusion, blood oxygen level-dependent transverse relaxation rate (R2*) to estimate oxygenation, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion (D), and longitudinal relaxation time (T1) to estimate tissue properties were determined bilaterally in the cortex and outer and inner medulla. Additionally, phase-contrast MRI was applied in the renal arteries to quantify total renal blood flow. The results demonstrated profound gradients of perfusion, ADC, and D with highest values in the kidney cortex and a decrease towards the inner medulla. R2* and T1 were lowest in kidney cortex and increased towards the inner medulla. Total renal blood flow correlated with body surface area, body mass index, and renal volume. Similar patterns in all investigated parameters were observed in women and men. In conclusion, noninvasive MRI provides useful tools to evaluate intrarenal differences in blood flow, perfusion, diffusion, oxygenation, and structural properties of the kidney tissue. As such, this experimental approach has the potential to advance our present understanding regarding normal physiology and the pathological processes associated with acute and chronic kidney disease.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study sought to test the diagnostic performance of native T1 mapping in acute myocarditis compared with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques such as dark-blood T2-weighted (T2W)-CMR, bright-blood T2W-CMR, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging. Background The diagnosis of acute myocarditis on CMR often requires multiple techniques, including T2W, early gadolinium enhancement, and LGE imaging. Novel techniques such as T1 mapping and bright-blood T2W-CMR are also sensitive to changes in free water content. We hypothesized that these techniques can serve as new and potentially superior diagnostic criteria for myocarditis. Methods We investigated 50 patients with suspected acute myocarditis (age 42 {$\pm$} 16 years; 22\% women) and 45 controls (age 42 {$\pm$} 14 years; 22\% women). CMR at 1.5-T (median 3 days from presentation) included: 1) dark-blood T2W-CMR (short-tau inversion recovery); 2) bright-blood T2W-CMR (acquisition for cardiac unified T2 edema); 3) native T1 mapping (shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery); and 4) LGE. Image analysis included: 1) global T2 signal intensity ratio of myocardium compared with skeletal muscle; 2) myocardial T1 relaxation times; and 3) areas of LGE. Results Compared with controls, patients had significantly higher global T2 signal intensity ratios by dark-blood T2W-CMR (1.73 {$\pm$} 0.27 vs. 1.56 {$\pm$} 0.15, p {$<$} 0.01), bright-blood T2W-CMR (2.02 {$\pm$} 0.33 vs. 1.84 {$\pm$} 0.17, p {$<$} 0.01), and mean myocardial T1 (1,010 {$\pm$} 65 ms vs. 941 {$\pm$} 18 ms, p {$<$} 0.01). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed clear differences in diagnostic performance. The areas under the curve for each method were: T1 mapping (0.95), LGE (0.96), dark-blood T2 (0.78), and bright-blood T2 (0.76). A T1 cutoff of 990 ms had a sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 90\%, 91\%, and 91\%, respectively. Conclusions Native T1 mapping as a novel criterion for the detection of acute myocarditis showed excellent and superior diagnostic performance compared with T2W-CMR. It also has a higher sensitivity compared with T2W and LGE techniques, which may be especially useful in detecting subtle~focal disease and when gadolinium contrast imaging is not feasible.},

Increasing evidence exists that molecular therapeutic strategies targeted to cyst formation and growth might be more efficacious in early disease stages, highlighting the growing need for sensitive biomarkers. Here we apply quantitative magnetic resonance imaging techniques of T2 mapping and diffusion-weighted imaging in the jck mouse model for PKD using a clinical 3.0 T scanner. We tested whether kidney T2 values and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) are superior to anatomical imaging parameters in the detection of early cystogenesis, as shown on macro- and histopathology. We also tested whether kidney T2 values and ADC have the potential to monitor early treatment effects of therapy with the V2 receptor antagonist Mozavaptane. Kidney T2 values and to a lesser degree ADC were found to be highly sensitive markers of early cystogenesis and superior to anatomical-based imaging parameters. Furthermore, kidney T2 values exhibited a nearly perfect correlation to the histological cystic index, allowing a clear separation of the two mouse genotypes. Additionally, kidney T2 values and ADC were able to monitor early treatment effects in the jck mouse model in a proof-of-principle experiment. Thus, given the superiority of kidney T2 values and ADC over anatomical-based imaging in mice, further studies are needed to evaluate the translational impact of these techniques in patients with PKD.},

In this translational study, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) T1 mapping and a new segmented Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) technique, for Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), were first compared to renal fibrosis in two well-controlled animal models to assess detection limits. Validation against biopsy was then performed in 33 kidney allograft recipients (KARs). Predictive MRI indices, {$\Delta$}T1 and {$\Delta$}ADC (defined as the cortico-medullary differences), were compared to histology. In rats, both T1 and ADC correlated well with fibrosis and inflammation showing a difference between normal and diseased kidneys. In KARs, MRI indices were not sensitive to interstitial inflammation. By contrast, {$\Delta$}ADC outperformed {$\Delta$}T1 with a stronger negative correlation to fibrosis (R2\,=\,0.64 against R2\,=\,0.29 p\,{$<$}\,0.001). {$\Delta$}ADC tends to negative values in KARs harboring cortical fibrosis of more than 40\%. Using a discriminant analysis method, the {$\Delta$}ADC, as a marker to detect such level of fibrosis or higher, led to a specificity and sensitivity of 100\% and 71\%, respectively.

Methods Images and structure contours for 120 patients were collected retrospectively. Treatment sites included pancreas, liver, stomach, adrenal gland, and prostate. The proposed DL model contains a voxel-wise label prediction CNN and a correction network which consists of two sub-networks. The prediction CNN and sub-networks in the correction network each includes a dense block which consists of twelve densely connected convolutional layers. The correction network was designed to improve the voxel-wise labeling accuracy of a CNN by learning and enforcing implicit anatomical constraints in the segmentation process. Its sub-networks learn to fix the erroneous classification of its previous network by taking as input both the original images and the softmax probability maps generated from its previous sub-network. The parameters of each sub-network were trained independently using piecewise training. The model was trained on 100 datasets, validated on 10 datasets and tested on the remaining 10 datasets. Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance (HD) were calculated to evaluate the segmentation accuracy. Results The proposed DL model was able to segment the organs with good accuracy. The correction network outperformed the conditional random field (CRF), a most comparable method that is usually applied as a post-processing step. For the 10 testing patients, the average Dice coefficients were 95.3 {$\pm$} 0.73, 93.1 {$\pm$} 2.22, 85.0 {$\pm$} 3.75, 86.6 {$\pm$} 2.69, and 65.5 {$\pm$} 8.90 for liver, kidneys, stomach, bowel, and duodenum, respectively.

Manual contouring, as to correct the automatic segmentation results, was four times as fast as manual contouring from scratch. Conclusion The proposed method can automatically segment the liver, kidneys, stomach, bowel, and duodenum in 3D MR images with good accuracy. It is useful to expedite the manual contouring for MR-IGART.},

  abstract = {A neural network model for visual pattern recognition, called the ``neocognitron,'' was previously proposed by the author. In this paper, we discuss the mechanism of the model in detail. In order to demonstrate the ability of the neocognitron, we also discuss a pattern-recognition system which works with the mechanism of the neocognitron. The system has been implemented on a minicomputer and has been trained to recognize handwritten numerals. The neocognitron is a hierarchical network consisting of many layers of cells, and has variable connections between the cells in adjoining layers. It can acquire the ability to recognize patterns by learning, and can be trained to recognize any set of patterns. After finishing the process of learning, pattern recognition is performed on the basis of similarity in shape between patterns, and is not affected by deformation, nor by changes in size, nor by shifts in the position of the input patterns. In the hierarchical network of the neocognitron, local features of the input pattern are extracted by the cells of a lower stage, and they are gradually integrated into more global features. Finally, each cell of the highest stage integrates all the information of the input pattern, and responds only to one specific pattern. Thus, the response of the cells of the highest stage shows the final result of the pattern-recognition of the network. During this process of extracting and integrating features, errors in the relative position of local features are gradually tolerated. The operation of tolerating positional error a little at a time at each stage, rather than all in one step, plays an important role in endowing the network with an ability to recognize even distorted patterns.},

Materials and Methods A range of graded gas mixtures (hyperoxia, hypercapnia, hypoxia, and hypercapnic hypoxia) were delivered through a controlled gas-mixing circuit to mechanically ventilated and intubated rats. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a 3T clinical scanner; T2* and T1 maps were computed to determine tissue response in the liver, kidney cortex, and paraspinal muscles. Heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) were measured through a rodent oximeter and physiological monitor. Results T2* decreases consistent with lowered SaO2 measurements were observed for hypercapnia and hypoxia, but decreases were significant only in liver and kidney cortex (P {$<$} 0.05) for {$>$}10\% CO2 and {$<$}15\% O2, with the new gas stimulus, hypercapnic hypoxia, producing the greatest T2* decrease. Hyperoxia-related T2* increases were accompanied by negligible increases in SaO2. T1 generally increased, if at all, in the liver and decreased in the kidney. Significance was observed (P {$<$} 0.05) only in kidney for {$>$}90\% O2 and {$>$}5\% CO2. Conclusion T2* and T1 provide complementary roles for evaluating extracranial tissue response to a broad range of gas challenges.

The mean values of the ADC and FA, for each ROI site, were obtained in each group and were compared. Furthermore, the correlations between the diffusion parameters and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were determined.ResultsIn both the normal and affected kidneys, we obtained the cortico-medullary difference of the ADC and the FA values. The FA value in the medulla was significantly lower (P = 0.0149) in patients with renal function impairment as compared to patients with normal renal function. A direct correlation between DTI parameters and the eGFR was not found. Tractography visualised disruption of the regular arrangement of the tracts in patient with renal function alteration.ConclusionDTI could be a useful tool in the evaluation of chronic kidney disease and, in particular, the medullary FA value seems to be the main parameter for assessing renal damage.Key Points\textbullet{} Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MRDTI) provides new information about renal problems. \textbullet{} DTI allows non-invasive repeatable evaluation of the renal parenchyma, without contrast media. \textbullet{} DTI could become useful in the management of chronic parenchymal disease. \textbullet{} DTI seems more appropriate for renal evaluation than diffusion-weighted imaging.},

While ASL has been validated in animals and healthy volunteers (HVs), application to chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been limited. We investigated the utility of ASL MRI in patients with CKD. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} We studied renal perfusion in 24 HVs and 17 patients with CKD (age 22-77 years, 40\% male) using ASL MRI at 3.0T. Kidney function was determined using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). T1 relaxation time was measured using modified look-locker inversion and \&\#xFB02;ow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery true-fast imaging and steady precession was performed to measure cortical and whole kidney perfusion. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} T1 was higher in CKD within cortex and whole kidney, and there was association between T1 time and eGFR. No association was seen between kidney size and volume and either T1, or ASL perfusion. Perfusion was lower in CKD in cortex (136 {$\pm$} 37 vs. 279 {$\pm$} 69 ml/min/100 g; p {$<$} 0.001) and whole kidney (146 {$\pm$} 24 vs. 221 {$\pm$} 38 ml/min/100 g; p {$<$} 0.001). There was significant, negative, association between T1 longitudinal relaxation time and ASL perfusion in both the cortex (r = -0.75, p {$<$} 0.001) and whole kidney (r = -0.50, p {$<$} 0.001). There was correlation between eGFR and both cortical (r = 0.73, p {$<$} 0.01) and whole kidney (r = 0.69, p {$<$} 0.01) perfusion. \textbf{\emph{Conclusions:}} Significant differences in renal structure and function were demonstrated using ASL MRI. T1 may be representative of structural changes associated with CKD; however, further investigation is required into the pathological correlates of reduced ASL perfusion and increased T1 time in CKD.},

We developed a 3-D segmentation framework for fully automatic kidney parenchyma volumetry that uses Bayesian concepts for probability map generation. The probability map quality is improved in a multistep refinement approach. An extended prior shape level set segmentation method is then applied on the refined probability maps. The segmentation quality is improved by incorporating an exterior cortex edge alignment technique using cortex probability maps. In contrast to previous approaches, we combine several relevant kidney parenchyma features in a sequence of segmentation techniques for successful parenchyma delineation on native MR datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method is able to recognize and exclude parenchymal cysts from the parenchymal volume. We analyzed four different quality measures showing better results for right parenchymal tissue than for left parenchymal tissue due to an incorporated liver part removal in the segmentation framework. The results show that the outer cortex edge alignment approach successfully improves the quality measures.},

However, this technique suffers from the problems of the transfer insensitive labeling technique upon which it is based. In particular, RPI is very sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneities, and therefore the definition of the labeled bolus can deteriorate at field strength higher than 1.5 T. Furthermore, the slab-selective triple-pulse postsaturation sequence used originally will also be impaired due to the same problem, rendering RPI unusable at higher field. In this work, an adiabatic-based signal targeting with alternating radiofrequency pulses sequence is proposed as a labeling scheme to solve the problems related to variations in local magnetic field, together with an improved four-pulse water suppression enhanced through T1 effects technique as a presaturation scheme.

  abstract = {Cerebral blood flow can be studied in a multislice mode with a recently proposed perfusion sequence using inversion of water spins as an endogenous tracer without magnetization transfer artifacts. The magnetization transfer insensitive labeling technique (TILT) has been used for mapping blood flow changes at a microvascular level under motor activation in a multislice mode. In TILT, perfusion mapping is achieved by subtraction of a perfusion-sensitized image from a control image. Perfusion weighting is accomplished by proximal blood labeling using two 90\textdegree{} radiofrequency excitation pulses. For control preparation the labeling pulses are modified such that they have no net effect on blood water magnetization. The percentage of blood flow change, as well as its spatial extent, has been studied in single and multislice modes with varying delays between labeling and imaging. The average perfusion signal change due to activation was 36.9 {$\pm$} 9.1\% in the single-slice experiments and 38.1 {$\pm$} 7.9\% in the multislice experiments. The volume of activated brain areas amounted to 1.51 {$\pm$} 0.95 cm3 in the contralateral primary motor (M1) area, 0.90 {$\pm$} 0.72 cc in the ipsilateral M1 area, 1.27 {$\pm$} 0.39 cm3 in the contralateral and 1.42 {$\pm$} 0.75 cm3 in the ipsilateral premotor areas, and 0.71 {$\pm$} 0.19 cm3 in the supplementary motor area.J.

  abstract = {: OBJECTIVE. The purpose of our study was to measure relaxation times in musculoskeletal tissues at 1.5 and 3.0 T to optimize musculoskeletal MRI methods at 3.0 T.MATERIALS AND METHODS. In the knees of five healthy volunteers, we measured the T1 and T2 relaxation times of cartilage, synovial fluid, muscle, marrow, and fat at 1.5 and 3.0 T. The T1 relaxation times were measured using a spiral Look-Locker sequence with eight samples along the T1 recovery curve. The T2 relaxation times were measured using a spiral T2 preparation sequence with six echoes. Accuracy and repeatability of the T1 and T2 measurement sequences were verified in phantoms.RESULTS. T1 relaxation times in cartilage, muscle, synovial fluid, marrow, and subcutaneous fat at 3.0 T were consistently higher than those measured at 1.5 T. Measured T2 relaxation times were reduced at 3.0 T compared with 1.5 T. Relaxation time measurements in vivo were verified using calculated and measured signal-to-noise results. Relaxation times were used to develop a high-resolution protocol for T2-weighted imaging of the knee at 3.0 T.CONCLUSION. MRI at 3.0 T can improve resolution and speed in musculoskeletal imaging; however, interactions between field strength and relaxation times need to be considered for optimal image contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. Scanning can be performed in shorter times at 3.0 T using single-average acquisitions. Efficient higher-resolution imaging at 3.0 T can be done by increasing the TR to account for increased T1 relaxation times and acquiring thinner slices than at 1.5 T.},

Materials and Methods Age, gender, height, body weight, body mass index, body surface area and serum creatinine were recorded for 539 normal individuals. A tissue segmentation tool program was used to measure kidney volume from computerized tomography images. The glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation and an abbreviated modification of diet in renal disease equation. We looked for correlations of renal parenchymal volume with age and anthropometric measurements. We also tested for a correlation between kidney volume and renal function using the glomerular filtration rate according to the Cockcroft-Gault and modification of diet in renal disease equations. Results Mean kidney volume in all participants was 261.3 {$\pm$} 58.1 ml. Mean volume in men was approximately 14 ml greater than in women (266.1 vs 251.8 ml, p = 0.004). Kidney volume correlated significantly with height (r = 0.344, p \&lt;0.001), body weight (r = 0.343, p \&lt;0.001), body mass index (r = 0.177, p \&lt;0.001), body surface area (r = 0.371, p \&lt;0.001) and age (r = -0.418, p \&lt;0.001). Kidney volume also correlated with the glomerular filtration rate according to the Cockcroft-Gault and modification of diet in renal disease equations (p \&lt;0.001, r = 0.615 and p \&lt;0.001, r = 0.432, respectively). Kidney volume and the glomerular filtration rate decreased in parallel with increasing age. Conclusions Kidney volume correlates well with renal function and anthropometric measurements. Knowledge of these relationships will be valuable in clinical urology and nephrology.},

The study cohort consisted of 33 patients who underwent MRI (with diffusion-weighted imaging at b values of 0 and 500 s/mm2) and were found to have 36 pathologically-proven RCCs. ADC values were determined for solid portions of RCC, cystic/hemorrhagic areas, and normal renal parenchyma. Histological subtype, nuclear grade, and cell count were determined for each lesion. ADC values were compared between different grades and subtypes and correlation with cell count was investigated. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn to establish cut-off ADC values.ResultsThere were 23 low grade (grades I and II) and 13 high grade tumors (grades III and IV). There were 32 clear-cell and four non-clear-cell RCCs. A decreasing trend of ADC values was seen with increasing grade and mean ADC of high grade RCC was significantly lower than low grade (1.3145 vs 1.6982 ? 10?3 mm2/s) (P = 0.005). Mean ADC for clear-cell RCC was significantly higher than non-clear-cell RCC (1.6245 vs. 1.0412 ? 10?3 mm2/s) (P = 0.005). ADC values higher than 1.7960 ? 10?3 mm2/s were seen only with low grade and values greater than 1.4904 ? 10?3 mm2/s were seen only with clear-cell RCC.ConclusionADC values provide a non-invasive means to predict the nuclear grade and histological subtype of RCC. Cellularity and morphology are other tumor attributes contributing to the variation in ADC values of RCCs.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations in at least three different genes: PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3. ADPKD1 is an inherited disorder that has led to the discovery of a novel protein, polycystin. Polycystin, a 460 kd protein with a host of domains implicating a potential role in cell-cell and cell-matrix regulation, is encoded by a 52 kb gene with a 14 kb mRNA. The PKD2 protein is also large (110 kd) and is thought to interact with polycystin. ADPKD1 is caused by mutated DNA that encodes an abnormal form of polycystin. Polycystin appears to have a normal role in the differentiation of epithelial cells, and when defective, these cells fail to maturate fully. These incompletely differentiated cells proliferate abnormally and express altered amounts of otherwise normal electrolyte transport proteins that result in excessive secretion of solute and fluid into the cysts. The proliferation of the cells and the associated apoptosis, and the secretion of the fluid into the cysts created by the enlarging tubule segments appear to be regulated by growth factors, hormones, and cytokines that can alter the extent to which the disease is clinically expressed among individuals. The formation of the cysts is associated with complex changes in the extracellular matrix of the kidneys and other organs that may be directly or indirectly tied to mutated polycystin. The summation of these pathogenetic elements leads to renal interstitial infiltration, with monocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts culminating in fibrosis and progressive loss of renal function. The modern understanding of cyst pathogenesis opens opportunities to develop treatments that may diminish or halt altogether the progression of this disease.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Purpose To investigate the feasibility of measuring myocardial T2 at 3 Tesla for assessment of tissue iron in thalassemia major and other iron overloaded patients. Materials and Methods A single-breathhold electrocardiogram-triggered black-blood multi-echo spin-echo (MESE) sequence with a turbo factor of 2 was implemented at 3 Tesla (T). Myocardial and liver T2 values were measured with three repeated breathholds in 8 normal subjects and 24 patients. Their values, together with the T2* values measured using a breathhold multi-echo gradient-echo sequence, were compared with those at 1.5T in the same patients. Results At 3T, myocardial T2 was found to be 39.6 {$\pm$} 7.4 ms in normal subjects. In patients, it ranged from 12.9 to 50.1 ms. T2 and T2* were observed to correlate in heart ({$\rho$} = 0.93, {$\rho$} {$<$} 0.0001) and liver (P = 0.95, P {$<$} 0.0001). Myocardial T2 and T2* at 3T were also highly correlated with the 1.5T measurements. Preliminary results indicated that myocardial T2 quantitation was relatively insensitive to B1 variation, and reproducible with 3.2\% intra-exam and 3.8\% inter-exam variations. Conclusion Myocardial T2 quantitation is feasible at 3T. Given the substantially decreased T2* and increased B0 inhomogeneity, the rapid myocardial T2 measurement protocol demonstrated here may present a robust alternative to study cardiac iron overload at 3T.

Materials and Methods~The NIST/ISMRM (National Institute of Standards and Technology/International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine) phantom, containing spheres with standardized T1 and T2 relaxation times and proton density (PD), and 10 healthy volunteers, were scanned 10 times on different days and 2 times during the same session, using the MDME sequence, on three 3 T scanners from different vendors. For healthy volunteers, brain volumetry and myelin estimation were performed based on the measured T1, T2, and PD. The measured phantom values were compared with reference values; volunteer values were compared with their averages across 3 scanners.         Results~The linearity of both phantom and volunteer measurements in T1, T2, and PD values was very strong (R2 = 0.973\textendash 1.000, 0.979\textendash 1.000, and 0.982\textendash 0.999, respectively) The highest intrascanner coefficients of variation (CVs) for T1, T2, and PD were 2.07\%, 7.60\%, and 12.86\% for phantom data, and 1.33\%, 0.89\%, and 0.77\% for volunteer data, respectively. The highest interscanner CVs of T1, T2, and PD were 10.86\%, 15.27\%, and 9.95\% for phantom data, and 3.15\%, 5.76\%, and 3.21\% for volunteer data, respectively. Variation of T1 and T2 tended to be larger at higher values outside the range of those typically observed in brain tissue. The highest intrascanner and interscanner CVs for brain tissue volumetry were 2.50\% and 5.74\%, respectively, for cerebrospinal fluid.                    Conclusions~Quantitative values derived from the MDME sequence are overall robust for brain relaxometry and volumetry on 3 T scanners from different vendors. Caution is warranted when applying MDME sequence on anatomies with relaxometry values outside the range of those typically observed in brain tissue.},

  abstract = {Chemical tissue fixation, followed by embedding in either agarose or Fomblin, is common practice in time-intensive MRI studies of ex vivo biological samples, and is required to prevent tissue autolysis and sample motion. However, the combined effect of fixation and sample embedding may alter tissue structure and MRI properties. We investigated the progressive changes in T1 and T2 relaxation times, and the arrangement of locally prevailing cardiomyocyte orientation determined using diffusion tensor imaging, in embedded ex vivo rat hearts fixed using Karnovsky's solution (glutaraldehyde\textendash formaldehyde mix). Three embedding media were investigated: (i) standard agarose (n = 3 hearts); (ii) Fomblin (n = 4 hearts); and (iii) iso-osmotic agarose (n = 3 hearts); in the latter, the osmolarity of the fixative and embedding medium was adjusted to 300 mOsm to match more closely that of native tissue. The T1 relaxation time in the myocardium showed a pronounced decrease over a 48-h period following embedding in Fomblin (-11.3 {$\pm$} 6.2\%; mean {$\pm$} standard deviation), but was stable in standard agarose- and iso-osmotic agarose-embedded hearts. The mean myocardial T2 relaxation time increased in all embedded hearts: by 35.1 {$\pm$} 14.7\% with standard agarose embedding, 13.1 {$\pm$} 5.6\% with Fomblin and 13.3 {$\pm$} 1.4\% with iso-osmotic agarose. Deviation in the orientation of the primary eigenvector of the diffusion tensor occurred in all hearts (mean angular changes of 6.6\textdegree, 3.2\textdegree{} and 1.9\textdegree{} per voxel after 48 h in agarose-, Fomblin- and iso-osmotic agarose-embedded hearts, respectively), indicative of progressive structural changes in myocardial histo-architecture, in spite of previous exposure to fast-acting tissue fixation. Our results suggest that progressive structural changes occur in chemically fixed myocardium, and that the extent of these changes is modulated by the embedding medium, and by osmotic gradients between the fixative in the tissue and the surrounding medium.

Clinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies report changes of susceptibilities and relaxation rates in various neurological diseases which are often equated with changes in regional brain iron content. However, these mentioned metrics lack specificity for iron, since they are also influenced by the presence of myelin. In this study, we assessed the extent to which QSM and R2* reflect iron concentration as well as histological iron and myelin intensities. Six unfixed human post-mortem brains were imaged in situ with a 7 T MRI scanner. After formalin fixation, the brains were sliced axially and punched. 671 tissue punches were subjected to ferrozine iron quantification. Subsequently, brain slices were embedded in paraffin, and histological double-hemispheric axial brain slices were stained for Luxol fast blue (myelin) and diaminobenzidine (DAB)-enhanced Turnbull blue (iron). 3331 regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on the histological stainings to assess myelin and iron intensities, which were compared with MRI data in corresponding ROIs. QSM more closely reflected quantitative ferrozine iron values (r~=~0.755 vs. 0.738), whereas R2* correlated better with iron staining intensities (r = 0.619 vs. 0.445). Myelin intensities correlated negatively with QSM (r = -0.352), indicating a diamagnetic effect of myelin on susceptibility. Myelin intensities were higher in the thalamus than in the basal ganglia. A significant relationship was nonetheless observed between quantitative iron values and QSM, confirming the applicability of the latter in this brain region for iron quantification.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In recent years, several high-resolution vessel wall MR imaging techniques have emerged for the characterization of intracranial atherosclerotic vessel wall lesions in vivo. However, a thorough validation of MR imaging results of intracranial plaques with histopathology is still lacking. The aim of this study was to characterize atherosclerotic plaque components in a quantitative manner by obtaining the MR signal characteristics (T1, T2, T2*, and proton density) at 7T in ex vivo circle of Willis specimens and using histopathology for validation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multiparametric ultra-high-resolution quantitative MR imaging protocol was performed at 7T to identify the MR signal characteristics of different intracranial atherosclerotic plaque components, and using histopathology for validation. In total, 38 advanced plaques were matched between MR imaging and histology, and ROI analysis was performed on the identified tissue components. RESULTS: Mean T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times and proton density values were significantly different between different tissue components. The quantitative T1 map showed the most differences among individual tissue components of intracranial plaques with significant differences in T1 values between lipid accumulation (T1 = 838 {$\pm$} 167 ms), fibrous tissue (T1 = 583 {$\pm$} 161 ms), fibrous cap (T1 = 481 {$\pm$} 98 ms), calcifications (T1 = 314 {$\pm$} 39 ms), and the intracranial arterial vessel wall (T1 = 436 {$\pm$} 122 ms). CONCLUSIONS: Different tissue components of advanced intracranial plaques have distinguishable imaging characteristics with ultra-high-resolution quantitative MR imaging at 7T. Based on this study, the most promising method for distinguishing intracranial plaque components is T1-weighted imaging.},

  abstract = {Liver biopsy is the standard test for the assessment of fibrosis in liver tissue of patients with chronic liver disease. Recent studies have used a non-invasive measure of T1 relaxation time to estimate the degree of fibrosis in a single slice of the liver. Here, we extend this work to measure T1 of the whole liver and investigate the effects of additional histological factors such as steatosis, inflammation and iron accumulation on the relationship between liver T1 and fibrosis. We prospectively enrolled patients who had previously undergone liver biopsy to have MR scans. A non-breath-holding, fast scanning protocol was used to acquire MR relaxation time data (T1 and T2*), and blood serum was used to determine the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score. Areas under the receiver operator curves (AUROCs) for T1 to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis were derived in a training cohort and then validated in a second cohort. Combining the cohorts, the influence of various histology factors on liver T1 relaxation time was investigated. The AUROCs (95\% confidence interval (CI)) for detecting advanced fibrosis (F {$\geq$} 3) and cirrhosis (F = 4) for the training cohort were 0.81 (0.65\textendash 0.96) and 0.92 (0.81\textendash 1.0) respectively (p {$<$} 0.01). Inflammation and iron accumulation were shown to significantly alter T1 in opposing directions in the absence of advanced fibrosis; inflammation increasing T1 and iron decreasing T1. A decision tree model was developed to allow the assessment of early liver disease based on relaxation times and ELF, and to screen for the need for biopsy. T1 relaxation time increases with advanced fibrosis in liver patients, but is also influenced by iron accumulation and inflammation. Together with ELF, relaxation time measures provide a marker to stratify patients with suspected liver disease for biopsy. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The combination of diffusion MRI (dMRI) with microscopy provides unique opportunities to study microstructural features of tissue, particularly when acquired in the same sample. Microscopy is frequently used to validate dMRI microstructure models, addressing the indirect nature of dMRI signals. Typically, these modalities are analysed separately, and microscopy is taken as a gold standard against which dMRI-derived parameters are validated. Here we propose an alternative approach in which we combine dMRI and microscopy data obtained from the same tissue sample to drive a single, joint model. This simultaneous analysis allows us to take advantage of the breadth of information provided by complementary data acquired from different modalities. By applying this framework to a spherical-deconvolution analysis, we are able to overcome a known degeneracy between fibre dispersion and radial diffusion. Spherical-deconvolution based approaches typically estimate a global fibre response function to determine the fibre orientation distribution in each voxel. However, the assumption of a `brain-wide' fibre response function may be challenged if the diffusion characteristics of white matter vary across the brain. Using a generative joint dMRI-histology model, we demonstrate that the fibre response function is dependent on local anatomy, and that current spherical-deconvolution based models may be overestimating dispersion and underestimating the number of distinct fibre populations per voxel.},

  abstract = {ObjectivesTo evaluate MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as non-invasive diagnostic tool for detection of acute and chronic allograft dysfunction and changes of organ microstructure.Methods15 kidney transplanted patients with allograft dysfunction and 14 healthy volunteers were examined using a fat-saturated echo-planar DTI-sequence at 1.5 T (6 diffusion directions, b = 0, 600 s/mm{$^2$}). Mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated separately for the cortex and for the medulla and compared between healthy and transplanted kidneys. Furthermore, the correlation between diffusion parameters and estimated GFR was determined.ResultsThe ADC in the cortex and in the medulla were lower in transplanted than in healthy kidneys (p {$<$} 0.01). Differences were more distinct for FA, especially in the renal medulla, with a significant reduction in allografts (p {$<$} 0.001). Furthermore, in transplanted patients a correlation between mean FA in the medulla and estimated GFR was observed (r = 0.72, p {$<$} 0.01). Tractography visualized changes in renal microstructure in patients with impaired allograft function.ConclusionsChanges in allograft function and microstructure can be detected and quantified using DTI. However, to prove the value of DTI for standard clinical application especially correlation of imaging findings and biopsy results is necessary.},

  abstract = {Delayed graft function (DGF) after kidney transplantation is not uncommon, and it is associated with long-term allograft impairment. Our aim was to compare renal perfusion changes measured with noninvasive functional MRI in patients early after kidney transplantation to renal function and allograft histology in biopsy samples. Forty-six patients underwent MRI 4\textendash 11 days after transplantation. Contrast-free MRI renal perfusion images were acquired using an arterial spin labeling technique. Renal function was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and renal biopsies were performed when indicated within 5 days of MRI. Twenty-six of 46 patients had DGF. Of these, nine patients had acute rejection (including borderline), and eight had other changes (e.g., tubular injury or glomerulosclerosis). Renal perfusion was significantly lower in the DGF group compared with the group with good allograft function (231 {$\pm$} 15 vs. 331 {$\pm$} 15 ml{$\cdot$}min-1{$\cdot$}100 g-1, P {$<$} 0.001). Living donor allografts exhibited significantly higher perfusion values compared with deceased donor allografts (P {$<$} 0.001). Renal perfusion significantly correlated with eGFR (r = 0.64, P {$<$} 0.001), resistance index (r = -0.57, P {$<$} 0.001), and cold ischemia time (r = -0.48, P {$<$} 0.01). Furthermore, renal perfusion impairment early after transplantation predicted inferior renal outcome and graft loss. In conclusion, noninvasive functional MRI detects renal perfusion impairment early after kidney transplantation in patients with DGF.},

Materials and Methods~         Allograft rejection was induced by transplantation of C57BL/6 (B6) donor kidneys into BALB/c recipients (allogenic ktx). B6 mice that received B6 kidneys served as controls (isogenic ktx). Three weeks after ktx, MRI was performed using a 7-T small-animal scanner. Flow sensitive alternating inversion recovery echoplanar imaging arterial spin labeling, multiecho turbo spin echo, and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences were acquired. Maps of renal perfusion, T2 and T1 relaxation times, and apparent diffusion coefficients were calculated. Histological changes in the kidney were evaluated according to Banff criteria. Renal cell infiltrates and fibrosis were quantified by immunohistochemistry. Differences between groups were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test, and the correlation of MRI parameters with renal histopathology was determined by Spearman correlation analysis.         Results~         After allogenic, but not isogenic, ktx, animals developed acute allograft rejection. Allogenic grafts were infiltrated by macrophages and T-lymphocytes and exhibited marked renal fibrosis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed stronger impairment of renal perfusion (56 {$\pm$} 7 vs 293 {$\pm$} 44 mL/[min \texttimes{} 100 g]; P {$<$} 0.01) and more pronounced increases in T2 (60.1 {$\pm$} 2.0 vs 45.7 {$\pm$} 1.2 milliseconds, P {$<$} 0.01) and T1 relaxation times (1938 {$\pm$} 53 vs 1350 {$\pm$} 27 milliseconds, P {$<$} 0.01) in allogenic than in isogenic kidneys. Apparent diffusion coefficient was reduced to 1.39 {$\pm$} 0.14 \texttimes{} 10-3 mm2/s in kidneys with an acute rejection and was 1.83 {$\pm$} 0.05 \texttimes{} 10-3 mm2/s in isogenic kidneys without rejection (P {$<$} 0.05). Magnetic resonance imaging parameters significantly correlated with the amount of cellular infiltration and renal fibrosis observed histologically.         Conclusions~         Functional MRI allows detection of acute renal allograft rejection after allogenic ktx in mice. Functional MRI parameters correlate with cell infiltrates and fibrosis. Thus, MRI may be used noninvasively and longitudinally to investigate mechanisms of renal allograft rejection and evaluate novel therapeutic strategies in experimental studies.},

Portal blood flow and hepatic tissue oxygenation were measured using a transonic flowmeter and near infrared spectroscopy while gas analysis was carried out on portal venous blood samples. The effects of breathing 13\%, 21\%, 50\%, or 100\% oxygen were compared in animals with steptozotocin-induced diabetes and in controls. In diabetic rats breathing 21\% oxygen, portal blood flow was significantly lower than in controls (7.2+/-0.7 vs. 9.1+/-0.8 ml/min, p {$<$} 0.05). In both groups, breathing 100\% oxygen significantly increased portal flow (to 8.4+/-1.0 and 12.2+/-0.7 ml/min, respectively). This effect was not secondary to hepatic arterial vasoconstriction because it was not prevented by hepatic artery ligation. In controls, breathing 100\% oxygen increased portal pO2 from 5.0+/-0.9 to 14.4+/-1.4 kPa (p {$<$} 0.05) and portal venous oxygen saturation (PSaO2) from 53.9+/-12.1\% to 92.9+/-1.4\% (p {$<$} 0.05), a value not significantly different from peripheral (arterial) saturation. Similarly, in diabetic animals pO2 rose from 5.6+/-0.3 to 11.7+/-0.4 kPa (p {$<$} 0.01) and SO2 from 55.5+/-5.2\% to 88.5+/-0.6\% (p {$<$} 0.05). Hepatic oxyhemoglobin rose and deoxyhemoglobin fell reciprocally as a function of the inspired oxygen concentration. Improved hepatic oxygenation observed in animals breathing oxygen-enriched gas mixtures results from an increase in splanchnic blood flow coupled with a marked increase in portal oxygen saturation. This effective arterialization of portal blood may have important consequences for the success of intraportal transplantation of pancreatic islets.},

Here, we evaluated the use of two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)-MRI, to assess kidney fibrosis and hypoxia of the cortex in 142 patients with either diabetic nephropathy (n = 43), CKD without diabetes (n = 76), or acute kidney injury (AKI) (n = 23). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of DW-MRI correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) in the diabetic nephropathy and CKD groups (r(2) = 0.56 and r(2) = 0.46, respectively). Although the T2* values of BOLD-MRI and eGFR displayed good correlation in the CKD group (r(2) = 0.38), we did not observe a significant correlation between these values in the diabetic nephropathy group, suggesting that factors other than tubulointerstitial alteration determine the degree of hypoxia in the renal cortex. In the AKI group, neither the T2* nor ADC values correlated with eGFR. Renal biopsies from patients with CKD demonstrated that the T2* and ADC MRI values correlated with renal pathology. Taken together, ADC and T2* values appear to serve as accurate indices for evaluating renal tubulointerstitial alterations and parenchymal hypoxia, respectively, in the cortex. Functional MRI can thus contribute to multilateral, noninvasive, in vivo assessment of kidney function.},

  abstract = {To develop a method for noninvasive evaluation of liver fibrosis, we investigated the differential sensitivities of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* mapping using corrections for the effects of liver iron. Liver fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. While collagen increases R2* relaxation, measures of R2* for fibrosis are confounded by liver iron, which may be present in the liver over a wide range of concentrations. The diamagnetic collagen contribution to susceptibility values measured by QSM is much less than the contribution of highly paramagnetic iron. In 19 ex vivo liver explants with and without fibrosis, QSM ({$\chi$}), R2* and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) maps were constructed from multiecho gradient-recalled echo (mGRE) sequence acquisition at 3 T. Median parameter values were recorded and differences between the MRI parameters in nonfibrotic vs. advanced fibrotic/cirrhotic samples were evaluated using Mann\textendash Whitney U tests and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Logistic regression with stepwise feature selection was employed to evaluate the utility of combined MRI measurements for detection of fibrosis. Median R2* increased in fibrotic vs. nonfibrotic liver samples (P = .041), while differences in {$\chi$} and PDFF were nonsignificant (P = .545 and P = .395, respectively). Logistic regression identified the combination of {$\chi$} and R2* significant for fibrosis detection (logit [prediction] = -8.45 + 0.23 R2* - 28.8 {$\chi$}). For this classifier, a highly significant difference between nonfibrotic vs. advanced fibrotic/cirrhotic samples was observed (P = .002). The model exhibited an AUC of 0.909 (P = .003) for detection of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, which was substantially higher compared with AUCs of the individual parameters (AUC 0.591\textendash 0.784). An integrated QSM and R2* analysis of mGRE 3 T imaging data is promising for noninvasive diagnostic assessment of liver fibrosis.},

  abstract = {Neonatal congenital heart disease (CHD) is associated with altered cerebral hemodynamics and increased risk of brain injury. Two novel noninvasive techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffuse optical and correlation spectroscopies (diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS), diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS)), were employed to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) of 32 anesthetized CHD neonates at rest and during hypercapnia. Cerebral venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and CBF were measured simultaneously with MRI in the superior sagittal sinus, yielding global oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and global CMRO2 in physiologic units. In addition, microvascular tissue oxygenation (StO2) and indices of microvascular CBF (BFI) and CMRO2 (CMRO2i) in the frontal cortex were determined by DOS/DCS. Median resting-state MRI-measured OEF, CBF, and CMRO2 were 0.38, 9.7\,mL/minute per 100\,g and 0.52\,mL O2/minute per 100\,g, respectively. These CBF and CMRO2 values are lower than literature reports for healthy term neonates (which are sparse and quantified using different methods) and resemble values reported for premature infants. Comparison of MRI measurements of global SvO2, CBF, and CMRO2 with corresponding local DOS/DCS measurements demonstrated strong linear correlations (R2=0.69, 0.67, 0.67; P{$<$}0.001), permitting calibration of DOS/DCS indices. The results suggest that MRI and optics offer new tools to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism in CHD neonates.},

The T1 of the renal cortex decreased significantly when breathing pure oxygen as compared to normoxia (from 882 {$\pm$} 59 to 829 {$\pm$} 70 msec, P {$<$} 0.05), while that of the renal medulla was unchanged. No significant changes were seen in the T\,*2 of either compartment. Dynamic imaging using an inversion recovery sequence with an optimized inversion time typically produced signal changes of 20\% in the renal cortex. Studies to assess if oxygen-induced changes in flow contributed to this effect showed that the flow contribution was not significant. Although longer inversion times (880 ms) produced optimal contrast, acceptable contrast was also obtained at shorter inversion times (450 msec) in the renal cortex, spleen, and lung, with the latter being of opposite polarity to the other two tissues, implying a shorter parenchymal T1 than previously reported in the literature.

  abstract = {Normal blood flow and velocity in the superior sagittal sinus were measured in 30 patients. A fast two-dimensional ungated phase-contrast (PC) pulse sequence was compared with a peripherally gated cine PC technique for velocity and flow quantitation. The same imaging parameters were used for both methods. Measured values for mean velocity and flow obtained with the two methods were compared by using regression analysis and t testing. For blood flow, the correlation coefficient was 0.976. For velocity measurements, r was 0.950. Mean flow was 285 mL/min {$\pm$} 19 with the ungated PC method and 281 mL/min {$\pm$} 19 with the cine PC method. The mean velocities measured with the two methods were 12.94 cm/sec {$\pm$} 1.1 and 13.59 cm/sec {$\pm$} 1.1, respectively. There was no significant difference (paired t test) between the methods for mean flow or velocity data. This was true even though flow in the superior sagittal sinus is moderately pulsatile, as shown with the cine PC technique. The ungated PC method provided these data in 13 seconds versus 3.5 minutes for the cine PC method.},

In ten healthy volunteers, the mean value of perfusion was 213 {$\pm$} 55 mL/(100g min) with a range from 140 to 319 mL/(100g min). These results are in accordance with literature data, considering the fact that FAIR only measures the perfusion component normal to the imaging plane.

Second, to compare MRI measurements of Vc using the semiautomatic segmentation method with a manual segmentation method. Third, to evaluate the reproducibility of Vc measurements. Materials and Methods A total of 22 pigs, 13 with healthy kidneys and nine with diseased kidneys, underwent MRI with two non-contrast-agent methods (MRI100\texttimes 900 and MRI300\texttimes 1100) and one contrast-agent method (MRIGd). For each of these methods, Vc was estimated using semiautomatic (Vc100\texttimes 900, Vc300\texttimes 1100, and VcGd), as well as manual (VcMANUAL) segmentation. Reference volumes were estimated by stereological means (VcSTEREOLOGY). MRI-derived volumes were compared with reference volumes using a two-tailed paired t-test, and variances between methods were visualized with Bland Altman plots. Reproducibilities were analyzed using covariance analysis. Results Neither measurements of Vc100\texttimes 900, Vc300\texttimes 1100, nor VcGd differed markedly from VcSTEREOLOGY using semiautomatic segmentation. Vc was comparable when semiautomatic and manual segmentations were performed at the same scan. Reproducibility of MRI estimated Vc values offered intra- and interindividual differences {$<$}5\%. Conclusion Vc can in both healthy and diseased kidneys be measured accurately with MRI using both semiautomatic and manual segmentation, and measurements can be obtained with a high reproducibility.

Following each scan, the tumors were excised into 2\textendash 3-mm thin slices parallel to the axial field of view and processed for histological staining. The MRI data were segmented using SRSC, K-means, fuzzy C-means, and Gaussian mixture modeling to estimate the fractional population of necrotic, peri-necrotic, and viable regions and validated with the fractional population obtained from histology.ResultsWhile the aforementioned methods overestimated peri-necrotic and underestimated viable fractions, SRSC accurately predicted the fractional population of all three tumor tissue types and exhibited strong correlations (rnecrotic = 0.92, rperi-necrotic = 0.82 and rviable = 0.98) with the histology.ConclusionsThe precise identification of necrotic, peri-necrotic and viable areas using SRSC may greatly assist in cancer treatment planning and add a new dimension to MRI-guided tumor biopsy procedures.},

Accuracy was evaluated on the phantom by comparing relaxation times measured by FISP\textendash MRF with the reference values provided by the phantom manufacturer. Daily repeatability was characterized as the coefficient of variation (CV) of the measurements over 100 days for the phantom and over 5 days for volunteers. In addition, the cross-scanner reproducibility was evaluated in volunteers.Results: In the phantom study, T1 and T2 values from FISP\textendash MRF showed a strong linear correlation with the reference values of the phantom (R2 = 0.9963 for T1; R2 = 0.9966 for T2). CVs were {$<$}1.0\% for T1 values larger than 300 ms, and {$<$}3.0\% for T2 values across a wide range. In the volunteer study, CVs for both T1 and T2 values were {$<$}5.0\%, except for one subject. In addition, all T2 values estimated by FISP\textendash MRF in vivo were lower than those measured with conventional mapping sequences reported in previous studies. The cross-scanner variation of T1 and T2 showed good agreement between two different scanners in the volunteers.Conclusion:  B1+-corrected FISP-MRF showed an acceptable accuracy, repeatability and reproducibility in the phantom and volunteer studies.},

  abstract = {Object Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain tumor is heterogeneous in nature, so its quantification depends on how to accurately segment different parts of the tumor, i.e. viable tumor, edema and necrosis. This procedure becomes more effective when metabolic and functional information, provided by physiological magnetic resonance (MR) imaging modalities, like diffusion-weighted-imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted-imaging (PWI), is incorporated with the anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this preliminary tumor quantification work, the idea is to characterize different regions of GBM tumors in an MRI-based semi-automatic multi-parametric approach to achieve more accurate characterization of pathogenic regions.Materials and methods For this purpose, three MR sequences, namely T2-weighted imaging (anatomical MR imaging), PWI and DWI of thirteen GBM patients, were acquired. To enhance the delineation of the boundaries of each pathogenic region (peri-tumoral edema, viable tumor and necrosis), the spatial fuzzy C-means algorithm is combined with the region growing method.ResultsThe results show that exploiting the multi-parametric approach along with the proposed semi-automatic segmentation method can differentiate various tumorous regions with over 80 \% sensitivity, specificity and dice score.ConclusionThe proposed MRI-based multi-parametric segmentation approach has the potential to accurately segment tumorous regions, leading to an efficient design of the pre-surgical treatment planning.},

  abstract = {T2-weighted MRI of edema in acute myocardial infarction (MI) provides a means of differentiating acute and chronic MI, and assessing the area at risk of infarction. Conventional T2-weighted imaging of edema uses a turbo spin-echo (TSE) readout with dark-blood preparation. Clinical applications of dark-blood TSE methods can be limited by artifacts such as posterior wall signal loss due to through-plane motion, and bright subendocardial artifacts due to stagnant blood. Single-shot imaging with a T2-prepared SSFP readout provides an alternative to dark-blood TSE and may be conducted during free breathing. We hypothesized that T2-prepared SSFP would be a more reliable method than dark-blood TSE for imaging of edema in patients with MI. In patients with MI (22 acute and nine chronic MI cases), T2-weighted imaging with both methods was performed prior to contrast administration and delayed-enhancement imaging. The T2-weighted images using TSE were nondiagnostic in three of 31 cases, while six additional cases rated as being of diagnostic quality yielded incorrect diagnoses. In all 31 cases the T2-prepared SSFP images were rated as diagnostic quality, correctly differentiated acute or chronic MI, and correctly determined the coronary territory. Free-breathing T2-prepared SSFP provides T2-weighted images of acute MI with fewer artifacts and better diagnostic accuracy than conventional dark-blood TSE.

Design, setting, participants, \& measurements Study patients were selected from the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease. At the enrollment of the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease Study in 2000, patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease were between 15 and 46 years of age with relatively preserved GFRs. Our fully automated segmentation method was on the basis of a spatial prior probability map of the location of kidneys in abdominal magnetic resonance images and regional mapping with total variation regularization and propagated shape constraints that were formulated into a level set framework. T2\textendash weighted magnetic resonance image sets of 120 kidneys were selected from 60 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and divided into the training and test datasets. The performance of the automated method in reference to the manual method was assessed by means of two metrics: Dice similarity coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient of segmented kidney volume. The training and test sets were swapped for crossvalidation and reanalyzed. Results Successful segmentation of kidneys was performed with the automated method in all test patients. The segmented kidney volumes ranged from 177.2 to 2634 ml (mean, 885.4{$\pm$}569.7 ml). The mean Dice similarity coefficient {$\pm$}SD between the automated and manual methods was 0.88{$\pm$}0.08. The mean correlation coefficient between the two segmentation methods for the segmented volume measurements was 0.97 (P{$<$}0.001 for each crossvalidation set). The results from the crossvalidation sets were highly comparable. Conclusions We have developed a fully automated method for segmentation of kidneys from abdominal magnetic resonance images in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with varying kidney volumes. The performance of the automated method was in good agreement with that of manual method.},

Two inversion recovery (IR) images are acquired by interleaving slice-selective inversion and nonselective inversion. During the inversion delay time after slice-selective inversion, fully magnetized blood spins move into the imaging slice and exchange with tissue water. The signal enhancement (FAIR image) measured by the signal difference between two images is directly related to blood flow. For functional MR imaging studies, two IR images are alternatively and repeatedly acquired during control and task periods. Relative signal changes in the FAIR images during the task periods represent the relative regional cerebral blood flow changes. The FAIR technique has been successfully applied to functional brain mapping studies in humans during finger opposition movements. The technique is capable of generating microvascular-based functional maps.},

  abstract = {Deep learning techniques are being rapidly applied to medical imaging tasks\textemdash from organ and lesion segmentation to tissue and tumor classification. These techniques are becoming the leading algorithmic approaches to solve inherently difficult image processing tasks. Currently, the most critical requirement for successful implementation lies in the need for relatively large datasets that can be used for training the deep learning networks. Based on our initial studies of MR imaging examinations of the kidneys of patients affected by polycystic kidney disease (PKD), we have generated a unique database of imaging data and corresponding reference standard segmentations of polycystic kidneys. In the study of PKD, segmentation of the kidneys is needed in order to measure total kidney volume (TKV). Automated methods to segment the kidneys and measure TKV are needed to increase measurement throughput and alleviate the inherent variability of human-derived measurements. We hypothesize that deep learning techniques can be leveraged to perform fast, accurate, reproducible, and fully automated segmentation of polycystic kidneys. Here, we describe a fully automated approach for segmenting PKD kidneys within MR images that simulates a multi-observer approach in order to create an accurate and robust method for the task of segmentation and computation of TKV for PKD patients. A total of 2000 cases were used for training and validation, and 400 cases were used for testing. The multi-observer ensemble method had mean~{$\pm~$}SD percent volume difference of 0.68~{$\pm~$}2.2\% compared with the reference standard segmentations. The complete framework performs fully automated segmentation at a level comparable with interobserver variability and could be considered as a replacement for the task of segmentation of PKD kidneys by a human.},

Here we explore the possibility that the use of T2 relaxometry may provide information complementary to that provided by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in ageing of healthy controls (HC), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). T2 and diffusion MRI metrics were quantified in HC and patients with MCI and mild AD using multi-echo MRI and DTI. We used tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to evaluate quantitative MRI parameters in white matter (WM). A prolonged T2 in WM was associated with AD, and able to distinguish AD from MCI, and AD from HC. Shorter WM T2 was associated with better cognition and younger age in general. In no case was a reduction in T2 associated with poorer cognition. We also applied principal component analysis, showing that WM volume changes independently of T2, MRI diffusion indices and cognitive performance indices. Our data add to the evidence that age-related and AD-related decline in cognition is in part attributable to WM tissue state, and much less to WM quantity. These observations suggest that WM is involved in AD pathology, and that T2 relaxometry is a potential imaging modality for detecting and characterising WM in cognitive decline and dementia.},

However, dedicated validation of these sequences with histology has not yet been performed. The current study assessed the ability of ultra-high-resolution 7T MR imaging sequences with different image contrast weightings to image plaque components, by using histology as criterion standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five specimens of the circle of Wills were imaged at 7T with 0.11 \texttimes{} 0.11 mm in-plane-resolution proton attenuation\textendash, T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted sequences (through-plane resolution, 0.11\textendash 1 mm). Tissue samples from 13 fiducial-marked locations (per specimen) on MR imaging underwent histologic processing and atherosclerotic plaque classification. Reconstructed MR images were matched with histologic sections at corresponding locations. RESULTS: Forty-four samples were available for subsequent evaluation of agreement or disagreement between plaque components and image contrast differences. Of samples, 52.3\% (n = 23) showed no image contrast heterogeneity; this group comprised solely no lesions or early lesions. Of samples, 25.0\% (n = 11, mostly advanced lesions) showed good correlation between the spatial organization of MR imaging heterogeneities and plaque components. Areas of foamy macrophages were generally seen as proton attenuation\textendash, T2-, and T2*- hypointense areas, while areas of increased collagen content showed more ambiguous signal intensities. Five samples showed image-contrast heterogeneity without corresponding plaque components on histology; 5 other samples showed contrast heterogeneity based on intima-media artifacts. CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging at 7T has the image contrast capable of identifying both focal intracranial vessel wall thickening and distinguishing areas of different signal intensities spatially corresponding to plaque components within more advanced atherosclerotic plaques.},

We compared 23Na-MRI data with actual tissue Na+ content measured by chemical analysis in animal and human tissue. We then quantified tissue Na+ content in normal humans and in patients with primary aldosteronism. We found a 29\% increase in muscle Na+ content in patients with aldosteronism compared with normal women and men. This tissue Na+ was mobilized after successful treatment without accompanying weight loss. We suggest that, after further refinements, this tool could facilitate understanding the relationships between Na+ accumulation and hypertension.

Methods All thalassemia patients who underwent CMR were enrolled on a clinical 1.5T scanner. Native T1 mapping with the Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery (MOLLI) technique, T2 mapping using a black-blood multi-echo spin-echo technique, and conventional T2* mapping using multi-echo gradient-echo techniques were performed. CIO was defined by a T2* of {$<$}20ms; while severe CIO was considered as {$<$}10ms. Results A total of 200 patients were enrolled in the study (23.9{$\pm$}14.6years old [mean{$\pm$}SD], 102 male). Among these, 8 patients (4.0\%) had CIO. Both native T1 and T2 times were significant different among patients with no CIO, mild-to-moderate CIO, and severe CIO (1012.7{$\pm$}57.7 vs. 846.4{$\pm$}34.4 vs 601.3{$\pm$}34.6ms for T1, p{$<$}0.05; 59.6{$\pm$}6.5 vs. 48.7{$\pm$}2.5 vs. 32.8{$\pm$}1.2ms for T2, p{$<$}0.05). The best cut-off values for detection of CIO were 887 and 52ms for T1 and T2, respectively. This yielded a sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of 100\%, 98.4\% and 0.997 respectively for T1, in comparison to 100\%, 88.8\% and 0.961 respectively for T2. Conclusions Native T1 mapping can differentiate between severe, mild-to-moderate, and no CIO, which appears to be a promising technique for detection and assessment of myocardial iron.},

Quantitative MRI may be the only imaging modality that can address this difficult and important problem. MR susceptometry\textendash based oximetry for measuring blood oxygen saturation in large vessels models the vessel as a long paramagnetic cylinder immersed in an external field. The intravascular magnetic susceptibility relative to surrounding muscle tissue is a function of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and can be quantified with a field-mapping pulse sequence. In this work, the method's accuracy and precision was investigated theoretically on the basis of an analytical expression for the arbitrarily oriented cylinder, as well as experimentally in phantoms and in vivo in the femoral artery and vein at 3T field strength. Errors resulting from vessel tilt, noncircularity of vessel cross-section, and induced magnetic field gradients were evaluated and methods for correction were designed and implemented. Hemoglobin saturation was measured at successive vessel segments, differing in geometry, such as eccentricity and vessel tilt, but constant blood oxygen saturation levels, as a means to evaluate measurement consistency. The average standard error and coefficient of variation of measurements in phantoms were {$<$}2\% with tilt correction alone, in agreement with theory, suggesting that high accuracy and reproducibility can be achieved while ignoring noncircularity for tilt angles up to about 30\textdegree. In vivo, repeated measurements of \%HbO2 in the femoral vessels yielded a coefficient of variation of less than 5\%. In conclusion, the data suggest that \%HbO2 can be measured reproducibly in vivo in large vessels of the peripheral circulation on the basis of the paramagnetic cylinder approximation of the incremental field.

It is known that intrarenal hypoxia is present in several diseases associated with development of kidney disease, including diabetes, and when renal blood flow is unaffected. The importance of deranged oxygen metabolism is further supported by deterioration of kidney function in patients with diabetes living at high altitude. Thus, we argue that reduced oxygen availability alters renal energy metabolism. Here, we introduce a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach to monitor metabolic changes associated with diabetes and oxygen availability. Streptozotocin diabetic and control rats were given reduced, normal, or increased inspired oxygen in order to alter tissue oxygenation. The effects on kidney oxygen metabolism were studied using hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate MRI. Reduced inspired oxygen did not alter renal metabolism in the control group. Reduced oxygen availability in the diabetic kidney altered energy metabolism by increasing lactate and alanine formation by 23\% and 34\%, respectively, whereas the bicarbonate flux was unchanged. Thus, the increased prevalence and severity of nephropathy in patients with diabetes at high altitudes may originate from the increased sensitivity toward inspired oxygen. This increased lactate production shifts the metabolic routs toward hypoxic pathways.},

Non-invasive microstructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) holds the potential to expand and translate these insights to basic and clinical human research, but the sensitivity and specificity of different MR markers to myelination is a subject of debate. To consolidate current knowledge on the topic, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that validate microstructural imaging by combining it with myelin histology. We find meta-analytic evidence for correlations between various myelin histology metrics and markers from different MRI modalities, including fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, macromolecular pool, magnetization transfer ratio, susceptibility and longitudinal relaxation rate, but not mean diffusivity. Meta-analytic correlation effect sizes range widely, between R2 = 0.26 and R2 = 0.82. However, formal comparisons between MRI-based myelin markers are limited by methodological variability, inconsistent reporting and potential for publication bias, thus preventing the establishment of a single most sensitive strategy to measure myelin with MRI. To facilitate further progress, we provide a detailed characterisation of the evaluated studies as an online resource. We also share a set of 12 recommendations for future studies validating putative MR-based myelin markers and deploying them in vivo in humans.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

  abstract = {The global cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), which reflects metabolic activity of the brain under various physiologic conditions, can be quantified using a method, referred to as `OxFlow', which simultaneously measures hemoglobin oxygen saturation in a draining vein (Yv) and total cerebral blood flow (tCBF). Conventional OxFlow (Conv-OxFlow) entails four interleaves incorporated in a single pulse sequence \textendash{} two for phase-contrast based measurement of tCBF in the supplying arteries of the neck, and two to measure the intra- to extravascular phase difference in the superior sagittal sinus to derive Yv [Jain et al., JCBFM 2010]. However, this approach limits achievable temporal resolution thus precluding capture of rapid changes of brain metabolic states such as the response to apneic stimuli. Here, we developed a time-efficient, multiplexed OxFlow method and evaluated its potential for measuring dynamic alterations in global CMRO2 during a breath-hold challenge. Two different implementations of multiplexed OxFlow were investigated: 1) simultaneous-echo-refocusing based OxFlow (SER-OxFlow) and 2) simultaneous-multi-slice imaging-based dual-band OxFlow (DB-OxFlow). The two sequences were implemented on 3 T scanners (Siemens TIM Trio and Prisma) and their performance was evaluated in comparison to Conv-OxFlow in ten healthy subjects for baseline CMRO2 quantification. Comparison of measured parameters (Yv, tCBF, CMRO2) revealed no significant bias of SER-OxFlow and DB-OxFlow, with respect to the reference Conv-OxFlow while improving temporal resolution two-fold (12.5 versus 25 s). Further acceleration shortened scan time to 8 and 6 s for SER and DB-OxFlow, respectively, for time-resolved CMRO2 measurement. The two sequences were able of capturing smooth transitions of Yv, tCBF, and CMRO2 over the time course consisting of 30 s of normal breathing, 30 s of volitional apnea, and 90 s of recovery. While both SER- and DB-OxFlow techniques provide significantly improved temporal resolution (by a factor of 3 \textendash{} 4 relative to Conv-OxFlow), DB-OxFlow was found to be superior for the study of short physiologic stimuli.},

  abstract = {Blood flow imaging is an important tool in cerebrovascular research. Mice are of special interest because of the potential of genetic engineering. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides three-dimensional noninvasive quantitative methods of cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging, but these MRI techniques have not yet been validated for mice. The authors compared CBF imaging using flow sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR)-MRI and 14C-Iodoantipyrine (IAP)-autoradiography in a mouse model of acute stroke. Twenty-nine male 129S6/SvEv mice were subjected to filamentous left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). CBF imaging was performed with 14C-IAP autoradiography and FAIR-MRI using two different anesthesia protocols, namely intravenous infusion of etomidate or inhalation of isoflurane, which differentially affect perfusion. Using 14C-IAP autoradiography, the average CBF in ml/(100~g⁎min) was 160{$\pm$}34 (isoflurane, n=5) vs. and 59{$\pm$}21 (etomidate, n=7) in the intact hemisphere and 43{$\pm$}12 (isoflurane, n=5) vs. 36{$\pm$}12 (etomidate, n=7) in the MCAo hemisphere. Using FAIR-MRI, the corresponding average CBFs were 208{$\pm$}56 (isoflurane, intact hemisphere, n=7), 84{$\pm$}9 (etomidate, intact hemisphere, n=7), 72{$\pm$}22 (isoflurane, MCAo hemisphere, n=7) and 48{$\pm$}13 (etomidate, MCAo hemisphere, n=7). Regression analysis showed a strong linear correlation between CBF measured with FAIR-MRI and 14C-IAP autoradiography, and FAIR-MRI overestimated CBF compared to autoradiography. FAIR-MRI provides repetitive quantitative measurements of hemispheric CBF in a mouse model of stroke.},

  abstract = {A key contributor to the progression of nearly all forms of CKD is fibrosis, a largely irreversible process that drives further kidney injury. Despite its importance, clinicians currently have no means of noninvasively assessing renal scar, and thus have historically relied on percutaneous renal biopsy to assess fibrotic burden. Although helpful in the initial diagnostic assessment, renal biopsy remains an imperfect test for fibrosis measurement, limited not only by its invasiveness, but also, because of the small amounts of tissue analyzed, its susceptibility to sampling bias. These concerns have limited not only the prognostic utility of biopsy analysis and its ability to guide therapeutic decisions, but also the clinical translation of experimental antifibrotic agents. Recent advances in imaging technology have raised the exciting possibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\textendash based renal scar analysis, by capitalizing on the differing physical features of fibrotic and nonfibrotic tissue. In this review, we describe two key fibrosis-induced pathologic changes (capillary loss and kidney stiffening) that can be imaged by MRI techniques, and the potential for these new MRI-based technologies to noninvasively image renal scar.},

An analysis in terms of rotation operators indicates that the overall effect of the sequence RX({$\pi$}/2 + {$\Delta$})RY({$\pi$} + 2{$\Delta$})RX({$\pi$}/2 + {$\Delta$}) is equivalent to an exact {$\pi$} pulse applied about an axis in the XY plane which is phase shifted by an angle {$\Delta$} with respect to the Y axis. Good spin state inversion is therefore achieved, but there is a phase shift of 2{$\Delta$} for odd-numbered echoes, which is canceled on even-numbered echoes. For spin systems with no homonuclear coupling, the degree of compensation exceeds that of the well-known Meiboom-Gill modificaation, while for coupled spin systems the composite pulse scheme provides effective compensation whereas the Meiboom-Gill method breaks down. The technique has been tested on the proton spectrum of 1,1,2-trichloroethane with deliberately misset refocusing pulses; gross fluctuations in intensity are observed unless the composite pulses are used. A slightly different composite pulse sequence is proposed for situations where radiofrequency offset effects are the dominant source of error.},

It is shown that it is possible to construct sequences of small numbers of pulses which rotate the magnetization vector in a manner analogous to a single pulse, but which have the advantage of being less sensitive to deviations in the radiofrequency field strength. Two new ``composite pulses'' are proposed which have this property and which convert longitudinal magnetization into transverse magnetization\textemdash a two-pulse sequence employing a 27{$\pi$}3 radian phase shift, and a four-pulse sequence. The problem of inversion of spin populations by a composite pulse is then addressed. It is shown that composite pulse sequences can be constructed which take magnetization vectors from the z axis to the -z axis via trajectories possessing either approximate reflection symmetry, or approximate rotational symmetry. It is shown that this symmetry may cause additional error compensation, and two new pulse sequences are suggested for NMR population inversion\textemdash one of three pulses, and one of nine pulses.

  abstract = {Susceptometry-based MR oximetry has previously been shown suitable for quantifying hemoglobin oxygen saturation in large vessels for studying vascular reactivity and quantification of global cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization. A key assumption underlying this method is that large vessels can be modeled as long paramagnetic cylinders. However, bifurcations, tapering, noncircular cross-section, and curvature of these vessels produce substantial deviations from cylindrical geometry, which may lead to errors in hemoglobin oxygen saturation quantification. Here, the accuracy of the ``long cylinder'' approximation is evaluated via numerical computation of the induced magnetic field from 3D segmented renditions of three veins of interest (superior sagittal sinus, femoral and jugular vein). At a typical venous oxygen saturation of 65\%, the absolute error in hemoglobin oxygen saturation estimated via a closed-form cylinder approximation was 2.6\% hemoglobin oxygen saturation averaged over three locations in the three veins studied and did not exceed 5\% for vessel tilt angles {$<$}30\textdegree{} at any one location. In conclusion, the simulation results provide a significant level of confidence for the validity of the cylinder approximation underlying MR susceptometry-based oximetry of large vessels.

  abstract = {Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death. To assist doctors in hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and treatment planning, an accurate and automatic liver and tumor segmentation method is highly demanded in the clinical practice. Recently, fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), including 2-D and 3-D FCNs, serve as the backbone in many volumetric image segmentation. However, 2-D convolutions cannot fully leverage the spatial information along the third dimension while 3-D convolutions suffer from high computational cost and GPU memory consumption. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid densely connected UNet (H-DenseUNet), which consists of a 2-D DenseUNet for efficiently extracting intra-slice features and a 3-D counterpart for hierarchically aggregating volumetric contexts under the spirit of the auto-context algorithm for liver and tumor segmentation. We formulate the learning process of the H-DenseUNet in an end-to-end manner, where the intra-slice representations and inter-slice features can be jointly optimized through a hybrid feature fusion layer. We extensively evaluated our method on the data set of the MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge and 3DIRCADb data set. Our method outperformed other state-of-the-arts on the segmentation results of tumors and achieved very competitive performance for liver segmentation even with a single model.},

However, it has known limitations in terms of distortions and artefacts using standard acquisition techniques. This study evaluates two alternative methods that offer the promise of improved image quality and the potential for more reliable and consistent diffusion data. Methods: Three DWI techniques were investigated; single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI), EPI combined with reduced volume excitation (ZOOMit; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and read-out segmentation with navigator-echo correction (RESOLVE; Siemens Healthcare). Daily measurements of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value were made in a quality assurance phantom to assess the repeatability of each sequence. In order to evaluate the geometric integrity of these sequences, ten normal volunteers were scanned, and the prostate was contoured to compare its similarity with T2 weighted images. Results: Phantom ADC values were significantly higher using the standard EPI sequence than those of the other two sequences. Differences were also observed between sequences in terms of repeatability, with RESOLVE and EPI performing better than ZOOMit. Overall, the RESOLVE sequence provided the best agreement for the in vivo data with smaller differences in volume and higher contour similarity than T2 weighted imaging. Conclusion: Important differences have been observed between each of the three techniques investigated with RESOLVE performing the best overall. We have adopted this sequence for routine RT simulation of prostate patients at Liverpool Cancer Therapy Centre. Advances in knowledge: This work will be of interest to the increasing number of centres wanting to incorporate quantitative DWI in a clinical setting.},

Correlations between imaging results and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as well as pathological damage (glomerular lesion and tubulointerstitial injury), were evaluated.ResultsThe renal cortical FA was significantly lower than the medullary in both normal and affected kidneys (p {$<$} 0.001). The parenchymal FA was significantly lower in patients than healthy controls, regardless of whether eGFR was reduced. There were positive correlations between eGFR and FA (cortex, r = 0.689, p = 0.000; and medulla, r = 0.696, p = 0.000), and between eGFR and ADC (cortex, r = 0.310, p = 0.017; and medulla, r = 0.356, p = 0.010).

Methods TRUST MRI was performed on a total of 250 healthy subjects, with 125 from the developer's site and 25 each from five other sites. All sites were equipped with a 3T MRI of the same vendor. The estimated Yv and the standard error of the estimation, {$\epsilon$}Yv, were compared across sites. Results The averaged Yv and {$\epsilon$}Yv across six sites were 61.1{$\pm$}1.4\% and 1.3{$\pm$}0.2\%, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the estimated Yv was dependent on age (p=0.009), but not on performance site. In contrast, the standard error of Yv estimation was site-dependent (p=0.024), but was all less than 1.5\%. Further analysis revealed that {$\epsilon$}Yv was positively associated with the amount of subject motion (p{$<$}0.001) but negatively associated with blood signal intensity (p{$<$}0.001).

Variants of DWI include intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), which differentiates between microstructural diffusion and vascular or tubular flow, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which quantifies diffusion directionality. Purpose To investigate the reproducibility of joint IVIM-DTI and compare controls to presurgical renal mass patients. Study Type Prospective cross-sectional. Subjects Thirteen healthy controls and ten presurgical renal mass patients were scanned. Ten controls were scanned twice to investigate reproducibility. Field Strength/Sequence Subjects were scanned on a 3T system using 10 b-values and 20 diffusion directions for IVIM-DTI in a study approved by the local Institutional Review Board. Assessment Retrospective coregistration and measurement of joint IVIM-DTI parameters were performed. Statistical Analysis Parameter reproducibility was defined as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) {$>$}0.7 and coefficient of variation (CV) {$<$}30\%. Patient data were stratified by lesion side (contralateral/ipsilateral) for comparison with controls. Corticomedullary differentiation was evaluated. Results In controls, the reproducible subset of REnal Flow and Microstructure AnisotroPy (REFMAP) parameters had average ICC = 0.82 and CV = 7.5\%. In renal mass patients, medullary fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly lower than in controls (0.227 {$\pm$} 0.072 vs. 0.291 {$\pm$} 0.044, P = 0.016 for the kidney contralateral to the mass and 0.228 {$\pm$} 0.070 vs. 0.291 {$\pm$} 0.044, P = 0.018 for the kidney ipsilateral). In the kidney ipsilateral to the mass, cortical Dp,radial was significantly higher than in controls (P = 0.012). Conversely, medullary Dp,axial was significantly lower in contralateral than ipsilateral kidneys (P = 0.027) and normal controls (P = 0.044). Data Conclusion REFMAP-MRI parameters provide unique information regarding renal dysfunction. In presurgical renal mass patients, directional flow changes were noted that were not identified with IVIM analysis alone. Both contralateral and ipsilateral kidneys in patients show reductions in structural diffusivities and anisotropy, while flow metrics showed opposing changes in contralateral vs. ipsilateral kidneys.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Knowledge of blood T1 and T2 is of major importance in many applications of MRI in neonates. However, to date, there has not been a systematic study to examine neonatal blood T1/T2 relaxometry. This present study aims to investigate this topic. METHODS: Using freshly collected blood samples from human umbilical cord, we performed in vitro experiments under controlled physiological conditions to measure blood T1 and T2 at 3 Tesla (T) and their dependence on several factors, including hematocrit (Hct), oxygenation (Y) and temperature. RESULTS: The arterial T1 in neonates was 1825{$\pm$}184 ms (Hct=0.42{$\pm$}0.08), longer than that of adult blood. Neonatal blood T1 was strongly dependent on Hct (P{$<$}0.001) and Y (P=0.005), and the dependence of T1 on Y was more prominent at higher Hct. The arterial T2 of neonatal blood was 191 ms at an Hct of 0.42, which was also longer than adult blood. Neonatal blood T2 was positively associated with blood oxygenation and negatively associated with hematocrit level, and can be characterized by an exchange model. Neonatal blood T1 was also positively associated with temperature (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSION: The values provided in this report may provide important reference and calibration information for sequence optimization and quantification of in vivo neonatal MRI studies.},

  abstract = {Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) is an important index of tissue viability and brain function, but this parameter cannot yet be measured routinely on clinical scanners. Recently, a noninvasive technique was proposed which estimates global CMRO2 by concomitantly measuring oxygen-extraction-fraction using T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging MRI and pulse oximetry, and cerebral-blood-flow using phase-contrast MRI. This study sought to establish a standard acquisition procedure for this technique and to evaluate its test\textendash retest reproducibility in healthy subjects. Each subject was examined in five sessions and each session included two measurements. Intrasession, intersession, and intersubject coefficients of variation for CMRO2 were found to be 3.84 {$\pm$} 1.44\% (N = 7, mean {$\pm$} standard deviation), 6.59 {$\pm$} 1.56\%, and 8.80\% respectively. These reproducibility values were comparable or slightly superior to 15O positron emission tomography (PET) results reported in the literature. It was also found that oxygen-extraction-fraction and cerebral-blood-flow tended to co-vary across sessions (P = 0.002) and subjects (P = 0.01), and their coefficients of variation were greater than that of CMRO2. The simplicity and reliability features may afford this global CMRO2 technique great potential for immediate clinical applications.

  abstract = {PurposeSegmentation of the liver from abdominal computed tomography (CT) images is an essential step in some computer-assisted clinical interventions, such as surgery planning for living donor liver transplant, radiotherapy and volume measurement. In this work, we develop a deep learning algorithm with graph cut refinement to automatically segment the liver in CT scans.MethodsThe proposed method consists of two main steps: (i) simultaneously liver detection and probabilistic segmentation using 3D convolutional neural network; (ii) accuracy refinement of the initial segmentation with graph cut and the previously learned probability map.ResultsThe proposed approach was validated on forty CT volumes taken from two public databases MICCAI-Sliver07 and 3Dircadb1. For the MICCAI-Sliver07 test dataset, the calculated mean ratios of volumetric overlap error (VOE), relative volume difference (RVD), average symmetric surface distance (ASD), root-mean-square symmetric surface distance (RMSD) and maximum symmetric surface distance (MSD) are 5.9, 2.7 \%, 0.91, 1.88 and 18.94 mm, respectively. For the 3Dircadb1 dataset, the calculated mean ratios of VOE, RVD, ASD, RMSD and MSD are 9.36, 0.97 \%, 1.89, 4.15 and 33.14 mm, respectively.ConclusionsThe proposed method is fully automatic without any user interaction. Quantitative results reveal that the proposed approach is efficient and accurate for hepatic volume estimation in a clinical setup. The high correlation between the automatic and manual references shows that the proposed method can be good enough to replace the time-consuming and nonreproducible manual segmentation method.},

This technique has shown promise for normalization of fMRI signals, for the assessment of oxygen metabolism, and in studies of cognitive aging and multiple sclerosis. However, a human validation study has not been conducted. In addition, the calibration curve used to convert blood T2 to Y has not accounted for the effects of hematocrit (Hct). In this study, we first conducted experiments on blood samples under physiologic conditions, and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill T2 was determined for a range of Y and Hct values. The data were fitted to a two-compartment exchange model to allow the characterization of a three-dimensional plot that can serve to calibrate the in vivo data. Next, in a validation study in humans, we showed that arterial Y estimated using TRUST MRI was 0.837 {$\pm$} 0.036 (N=7) during the inhalation of 14\% O2, which was in excellent agreement with the gold-standard Y values of 0.840 {$\pm$} 0.036 based on Pulse-Oximetry. These data suggest that the availability of this calibration plot should enhance the applicability of T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging MRI for noninvasive assessment of cerebral blood oxygenation.

In this study a novel technique, T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI, is developed to estimate oxygenation in venous vessels. This method uses the spin labeling principle to automatically isolate pure blood signals from which T2 relaxation times are determined using flow-insensitive T2-preparation pulses. The blood T2 is then converted to blood oxygenation using a calibration plot. In vivo experiments gave a baseline venous oxygenation of 64.8 {$\pm$} 6.3\% in sagittal sinus in healthy volunteers (n = 24). Reproducibility studies demonstrated that the standard deviation across trials was 2.0 {$\pm$} 1.1\%. The effects of repetition time and inversion time selections were investigated. The TRUST technique was further tested using various physiologic challenges. Hypercapnia induced an increase in venous oxygenation by 13.8 {$\pm$} 1.1\%. On the other hand, caffeine ingestion resulted in a decrease in oxygenation by 7.0 {$\pm$} 1.8\%. Contrast agent infusion (Gd-DTPA, 0.1 mmol/kg) reduced venous blood T2 by 11.2 ms. The results of this study show that TRUST MRI is a useful technique for quantitative assessment of blood oxygenation in the brain.

A significant advantage of MRI over other imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and nuclear imaging is that it clearly shows soft tissues in multi-contrasts. Compared with other medical image super-resolution methods that are in a single contrast, multi-contrast super-resolution studies can synergize multiple contrast images to achieve better super-resolution results. In this paper, we propose a one-level nonprogressive neural network for low up-sampling multi-contrast super-resolution and a two-level progressive network for high upsampling multi-contrast super-resolution. The proposed networks integrate multi-contrast information in a high-level feature space and optimize the imaging performance by minimizing a composite loss function, which includes mean-squared-error, adversarial loss, perceptual loss, and textural loss. Our experimental results demonstrate that 1) the proposed networks can produce MRI super-resolution images with good image quality and outperform other multi-contrast super-resolution methods in terms of structural similarity and peak signal-to-noise ratio; 2) combining multi-contrast information in a high-level feature space leads to a signicantly improved result than a combination in the lowlevel pixel space; and 3) the progressive network produces a better super-resolution image quality than the non-progressive network, even if the original low-resolution images were highly down-sampled.},

Until recently, only symptomatic treatments for ADPKD existed. However, therapies that address the underlying pathophysiology of ADPKD are now available and accurate identification of the rate of disease progression is essential. \textbf{\emph{Summary:}} Published data on the different imaging modalities for measuring kidney and cyst volumes in ADPKD are reviewed. The advantages and drawbacks of the different techniques for calculating kidney volume from renal imaging are also examined, including the use of manual planimetry, stereology, and the ellipsoid equation, as well as the prospect of semi- and fully automatic techniques. The translation of these approaches into clinical practice and their role in informing treatment decisions is discussed. \textbf{\emph{Key Messages:}} These new therapies require the accurate monitoring of disease progression, which along with diagnosis and prognosis, relies on the effective use of renal imaging techniques. There is growing support for the use of total kidney volume as a measure of cyst burden and as a prognostic predictor of renal function in ADPKD, showing promise as a marker of disease progression.},

These similarities are encoded in a graph using classification maps and low-level features. Random walks are used to identify the most informative node, which is equivalent to the label query sample in AL. To reduce computation time, a volume of interest (VOI) is identified and all subsequent analysis, such as probability map generation using semisupervised random forest classifiers and label query, is restricted to this VOI. The negative log-likelihood of the probability maps serves as the penalty cost in a second-order Markov random field cost function, which is optimized using graph cuts for prostate segmentation. Experimental results on the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2012 prostate segmentation challenge show the superior performance of our approach to conventional methods using fully supervised learning.},

Although multiple echoes can be used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in an image, by echo addition, rf pulse imperfections modify the echo amplitudes resulting in significant errors in the estimate of T2. Imperfect 180\textdegree{} pulses do not completely invert the transverse magnetization so that the magnitude of the transverse component is reduced and a longitudinal component is generated. Successive application of such imperfect pulses generates many components that interact in a complex manner. The amplitudes of successive echoes are affected whenever the transverse components refocus, whereas the longitudinal components may be rotated into the transverse plane by subsequent pulses and may often add to the image signal or give rise to an image artifact. These effects have been analyzed theoretically and have been demonstrated for a wide range of rf pulse imperfections using both simple and composite pulses, through computer simulations based on the numerical solution of the Bloch equations. The theoretical and simulation results have been substantiated through experiments performed on a mineral oil phantom using a resistive prototype MR scanner operating at 6.35 MHz. In this paper we report the effects of improper pulse amplitude or duration for nonselective rf pulses on resonance. We separately describe the other types of imperfections caused by off-resonance effects and the use of selective pulses. \textcopyright{} 1986 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) is a rapidly developing technology for quantitatively assessing the mechanical properties of tissue. The technology can be considered to be an imaging-based counterpart to palpation, commonly used by physicians to diagnose and characterize diseases. The success of palpation as a diagnostic method is based on the fact that the mechanical properties of tissues are often dramatically affected by the presence of disease processes such as cancer, inflammation, and fibrosis. MRE obtains information about the stiffness of tissue by assessing the propagation of mechanical waves through the tissue with a special magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. The technique essentially involves three steps:  generating shear waves in the tissue,acquiring MR images depicting the propagation of the induced shear waves andprocessing the images of the shear waves to generate quantitative maps of tissue stiffness, called elastograms. MRE is already being used clinically for the assessment of patients with chronic liver diseases and is emerging as a safe, reliable and noninvasive alternative to liver biopsy for staging hepatic fibrosis. MRE is also being investigated for application to pathologies of other organs including the brain, breast, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, lungs and skeletal muscle. The purpose of this review article is to introduce this technology to clinical anatomists and to summarize some of the current clinical applications that are being pursued.},

  abstract = {Most arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques apply echoplanar imaging (EPI) because this strategy provides relatively high SNR in short measuring times. Unfortunately, those techniques are very susceptible to static magnetic field inhomogeneities and perfusion signals from organs with fast transverse relaxation might decrease due to the exchange of water molecules in capillaries and organ tissue combined with relatively long echo times of EPI sequences. To overcome these problems a novel imaging technique, FAIR True-FISP, was developed. It combines a FAIR (flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery) perfusion preparation and a true fast imaging with steady precession (True-FISP) data acquisition strategy. True-FISP was chosen since this sequence type does not show the mentioned disadvantages of EPI, but provides a similar SNR per measuring time. An important problem of this approach is that True-FISP sequences usually work in a steady state which is independent of a previous preparation of magnetization. For this reason a sequence structure had to be developed which keeps the advantages of True-FISP and makes the signal intensity sensitive to the FAIR preparation. Breathhold and nonbreathhold examinations of kidneys are presented and possible strategies to quantitative flow measurements are reported. It is shown that correction of spatially inhomogeneous receiver coil characteristics is easily feasible and leads to clinically valuable perfusion examinations of kidneys without application of potentially nephrotoxic contrast media.

Especially common approaches to arterial spin labelling (ASL) perfusion imaging allowing quantitative assessment of specific perfusion rates are described in detail. The potential of ASL for perfusion imaging was tested in several types of tissue.MethodsAfter a systematic comparison of technical aspects of continuous and pulsed ASL techniques the standard kinetic model and tissue properties of influence to quantitative measurements of perfusion are reported. For the applications demonstrated in this paper a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) ASL perfusion preparation approach followed by true fast imaging with steady precession (true FISP) data recording was developed and implemented on whole-body scanners operating at 0.2, 1.5 and 3 T for quantitative perfusion measurement in various types of tissue.ResultsASL imaging provides a non-invasive tool for assessment of tissue perfusion rates in vivo. Images recorded from kidney, lung, brain, salivary gland and thyroid gland provide a spatial resolution of a few millimetres and sufficient signal to noise ratio in perfusion maps after 2\textendash 5 min of examination time.ConclusionsNewly developed ASL techniques provide especially high image quality and quantitative perfusion maps in tissues with relatively high perfusion rates (as also present in many tumours). Averaging of acquisitions and image subtraction procedures are mandatory, leading to the necessity of synchronization of data recording to breathing in abdominal and thoracic organs.},

Automated objective image quality metrics (IQMs) such as root mean squared error (RMSE) and the structural similarity index (SSIM) are commonly used surrogates for radiologists' perception of image quality, which can be considered the gold standard. By calculating the correlation between radiologists' subjective grading and various IQM scores on degraded MR images, we demonstrate that RMSE and SSIM do not correlate as well as other IQMs and are potentially not the most appropriate metrics for assessment of MR image quality.},

  abstract = {Medical imaging has made significant contributions to the characterization of malignant tumors. In many cases, however, maps from multiple modalities may be required for more complete tumor mapping. In this manuscript we propose an objective method for combining multiple imaging datasets with the goal of characterizing malignant tumors. We refer to the proposed technique as the percent overlap method (POM). To demonstrate the power and flexibility of the POM analysis, we present four patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Each patient had multiple magnetic resonance imaging procedures resulting in seven different parameter maps. Chemical shift imaging was used to provide three metabolite ratio maps (Cho:NAA, Cho:Cre, Lac:Cre). A perfusion scan provided regional cerebral blood volume and permeability maps. Diffusion and carbogen-based hypoxia mapping data were also acquired. Composite maps were formed for each patient using POM, then were compared to results from the ISODATA clustering technique. The POM maps of likely recurrent tumor regions were found to be consistent with the ISODATA clustering method. This manuscript presents an objective method for combining parameters from multiple physiologic imaging techniques into a single composite map. The accuracy of the map depends strongly on the sensitivity of the chosen imaging parameters to the disease process at the time of image acquisition. Further validation of this method may be achieved by correlation with histological data.},

It was found that altitude is the most important factor affecting the reference value of the hematocrit. As the altitude gradually increases, the reference value of the hematocrit also increases. The relationship is quite significant. By using the method of stepwise regression analysis, two multivariate regression equations were deduced: Y\textasciicircum 1 = 39.7 + 0.00328X1 + 0.00169X2 + 0.00117X5 {$\pm$} 2.3, Y\textasciicircum 2 = 38.8 + 0.00275X1 + 0.000578X2 \textendash 0.00298X4 {$\pm$} 2.2 In these equations, Y\textasciicircum 1 is the reference value of presenile men's hematocrit (\%); Y\textasciicircum 2 is the reference value of presenile women's hematocrit (\%); X1 is altitude (m); X2 is the average annual hours of sunshine (h); X4 is the average annual temperature (\textdegree C), and X5 is the average annual precipitation (mm). If the geographical index values in a particular area in China are known, the reference value of presenile human hematocrit in this area can be calculated approximately by means of the regression equations.

Materials and Methods:~         A total of 130 kidneys (patients/healthy volunteers: 83/47) were examined using renal artery MR flow measurements and renal parenchymal perfusion measurements, as well as contrast-enhanced MR angiography. Cine phase-contrast-flow measurements were performed using an ECG-gated fast low angle shot pulse sequence; perfusion was measured with an arterial spin labeling flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery technique. Contrast-enhanced MR angiography was performed with a fast 3D gradient echo sequence in a single breath hold. For evaluation, kidneys were divided into groups based on nephrologic diagnosis of the patient. Recursive partitioning and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to separate the different groups.         Results:~         Significant differences in mean renal artery flow and parenchymal perfusion were found in kidneys with renal artery stenosis as well as parenchymal disease as compared with healthy kidneys. Using a classification tree derived from the recursive partitioning, a specificity of 99\% and sensitivity of 69\% with a positive/negative predictive value of 97\%/84\% was achieved for the separation of healthy kidneys from kidneys with vascular, parenchymal or combined disease. The overall accuracy was 88\%.         Conclusion:~         The combination of cine PC flow measurements and MR perfusion measurements offers a comprehensive assessment of both renovascular and renoparenchymal disease and provide a noninvasive approach to differentiate between these kidneys and normal kidneys.},

While there is a relatively mature literature on post mortem diffusion imaging of animals, human brains have proven more challenging due to their incompatibility with high-performance scanners. This study presents a method for post mortem diffusion imaging of whole, human brains using a clinical 3-Tesla scanner with a 3D segmented EPI spin-echo sequence. Results in eleven brains at 0.94\texttimes 0.94\texttimes 0.94mm resolution are presented, and in a single brain at 0.73\texttimes 0.73\texttimes 0.73mm resolution. Region-of-interest analysis of diffusion tensor parameters indicate that these properties are altered compared to in vivo (reduced diffusivity and anisotropy), with significant dependence on post mortem interval (time from death to fixation). Despite these alterations, diffusion tractography of several major tracts is successfully demonstrated at both resolutions. We also report novel findings of cortical anisotropy and partial volume effects.},

Traditional teaching on neuroimaging usually consists of a series of lectures that emphasize the big picture rather than the foundations on which the techniques are based. The lectures are often paired with practical workshops in which students run imaging analyses using the graphical interface of specific neuroimaging software packages. Our experience suggests that this combination leaves the student with a superficial understanding of the underlying ideas, and an informal, inefficient, and inaccurate approach to analysis. To address these problems, we based our course around a substantial open-ended group project. This allowed us to teach: (a) computational tools to ensure computationally reproducible work, such as the Unix command line, structured code, version control, automated testing, and code review and (b) a clear understanding of the statistical techniques used for a basic analysis of a single run in an MRI scanner. The emphasis we put on the group project showed the importance of standard computational tools for accuracy, efficiency, and collaboration. The projects were broadly successful in engaging students in working reproducibly on real scientific questions. We propose that a course on this model should be the foundation for future programs in neuroimaging. We believe it will also serve as a model for teaching efficient and reproducible research in other fields of computational science.},

  abstract = {Objective: The study was undertaken to determine the pathologic basis of subtle abnormalities in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters observed in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in multiple sclerosis brains. Methods: Brain tissues were obtained through a rapid postmortem protocol that included in situ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Four types of MRI-defined regions of interest (ROIs) were analyzed: (1) regions that were abnormal on all images (T2T1MTR lesions); (2) NAWM regions with slightly abnormal MTR located close to white matter lesions (sa-WM Close); (3) NAWM regions with slightly abnormal MTR located far from lesions (sa-WM Far); and (4) NAWM regions with normal MTR (NAWM). Immunohistochemical analysis for each ROI comprised immunostaining for myelin, axonal markers, activated microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, plasma proteins, and blood vessels. Results: Forty-eight ROIs from 4 secondary progressive MS brains were analyzed. sa-WM Close ROIs were associated with significantly more axonal swellings. There were more enlarged major histocompatibility complex II+ microglia and macrophages detected in sa-WM Far, sa-WM Close, and T2T1MTR lesions than in NAWM. Across all ROIs, MTR and DTI measures were moderately correlated with myelin density, axonal area, and axonal counts. Excluding T2T1MTR lesions from analysis revealed that MTR and DTI measures in nonlesional white matter (WM) were correlated with activated microglia, but not with axonal or myelin integrity. Interpretation: The pathologic substrates for MRI abnormalities in NAWM vary based on distance from focal WM lesions. Close to WM lesions, axonal pathology and microglial activation may explain subtle MRI changes. Distant from lesions, microglial activation associated with proximity to cortical lesions might underlie MRI abnormalities. ANN NEUROL 2011},

  abstract = {Objective The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that white matter degeneration of the perforant path \textendash{} as part of the Papez circuit \textendash{} is a key feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), even in the absence of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or deposition of pTDP-43 inclusions in hippocampal granule cells. Methods We used diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI), polarized light imaging (PLI) and immunohistochemical analysis of post mortem hippocampus specimens from controls (n = 5) and ALS patients (n = 14) to study white matter degeneration in the perforant path. Results diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging demonstrated a decrease in fractional anisotropy (P = 0.01) and an increase in mean diffusivity (P = 0.01) in the perforant path in ALS compared to controls. PLI-myelin density was lower in ALS (P = 0.05) and correlated with fractional anisotropy (r = 0.52, P = 0.03). These results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry; both myelin (proteolipid protein, P = 0.03) and neurofilaments (SMI-312, P = 0.02) were lower in ALS. Two out of the fourteen ALS cases showed pTDP-43 pathology in the dentate gyrus, but with comparable myelination levels in the perforant path to other ALS cases. Conclusion We conclude that degeneration of the perforant path occurs in ALS patients and that this may occur before, or independent of, pTDP-43 aggregation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Future research should focus on correlating the degree of cognitive decline to the amount of white matter atrophy in the perforant path.},

Differentiation of the medulla and cortex is essential as these tissues have different biomarker distributions.

  abstract = {The increased signal-to-noise ratio available at high magnetic field makes possible the acquisition of clinically useful MR images either at higher resolution or for quantitative methods. The work in this thesis is focused on the development of quantitative imaging methods used to overcome difficulties due to high field MRI systems ({$>$} 3T). The protocols developed and presented here have been tested on various studies aiming at discriminating tissues based on their NMR properties. The quantities of interest in this thesis are the longitudinal relaxation time T1, as well as the magnetization transfer process, particularly the chemical exchange phenomenon involving amide protons which is highlighted particularly well at 7T under specific conditions. Both quantities (T1 and amide proton transfer) are related to the underlying structure of the tissues in-vivo, especially inside the white matter of the brain. While a standard weighted image at high resolution can provide indices of the extent of the pathology, a robust measure of the NMR properties of brain tissues can detect earlier abnormalities. A method based on a 3D Turbo FLASH readout and measuring reliably the T1 in-vivo for clinical studies at 7T is first presented. The other major part of this thesis presents magnetization transfer and chemical exchange phenomena. First a quantitative method is investigated at 7T, leading to a new model for exchange as well as contrast optimization possibility for imaging. Results using those methods are presented and applied in clinical setting, the main focus being to image reliably the brain of both healthy subjects and Multiple Sclerosis patients to look at myelin structures.},

  abstract = {Summary Neuronal cortical circuitry comprises feedforward, lateral, and feedback projections, each of which terminates in distinct cortical layers [1, 2, 3]. In sensory systems, feedforward processing transmits signals from the external world into the cortex, whereas feedback pathways signal the brain's inference of the world [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, the integration of feedforward, lateral, and feedback inputs within each cortical area impedes the investigation of feedback, and to date, no technique has isolated the feedback of visual scene information in distinct layers of healthy human cortex. We masked feedforward input to a region of V1 cortex and studied the remaining internal processing. Using high-resolution functional brain imaging (0.8~mm3) and multivoxel pattern information techniques, we demonstrate that during normal visual stimulation scene information peaks in mid-layers. Conversely, we found that contextual feedback information peaks in outer, superficial layers. Further, we found that shifting the position of the visual scene surrounding the mask parametrically modulates feedback in superficial layers of V1. Our results reveal the layered cortical organization of external versus internal visual processing streams during perception in healthy human subjects. We provide empirical support for theoretical feedback models such as predictive coding [10, 12] and coherent infomax [13] and reveal the potential of high-resolution fMRI to access internal processing in sub-millimeter human cortex.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of T2 mapping for the detection of myocardial edema in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and to compare this diagnostic accuracy with that of the current standard for myocardial edema imaging, which is T2w dark-blood TSE imaging.   Materials and Methods: 29 patients with AMI were examined at 1.5 T. For the visualization of myocardial edema, T2 maps, calculated from three T2w SSFP images, and T2w dark-blood TSE images were acquired in standard short- and long-axis views. Cine SSFP images were acquired for the analysis of left ventricular (LV) function and late gadolinium enhancement images (LGE) for the visualization of myocardial necrosis. The T2 maps as well as the T2w dark-blood TSE images were evaluated twice independently from the cine SSFP and LGE images. The presence or absence of myocardial edema was rated visually for each LV segment. As the standard of reference, the infarct zone was defined based on the cine SSFP and the LGE images.   Results: In this segment-based analysis, T2 mapping showed a sensitivity of 82 \% and a specificity of 94 \% for the detection of edema in the infarct zone. T2w dark-blood TSE imaging revealed a sensitivity of 50 \% and a specificity of 98 \%. T2 mapping showed a higher intra-rater agreement compared to T2w dark-blood TSE imaging ({$\kappa$}: 0.87 vs. 0.76).   Conclusions: T2 mapping allows for the visualization of myocardial edema in AMI with a high sensitivity and specificity, and features better diagnostic accuracy in terms of a higher sensitivity compared to T2w dark-blood TSE imaging.

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a powerful noninvasive tool to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition, investigators have used MRI metrics as supportive outcome measures to explore drug efficacy in clinical trials. Conventional MRI surrogates provide information at the macroscopic level but lack sensitivity and specificity in identifying the full extent of underlying MS pathology. They also show relatively weak relationships to clinical status such as predictive strength for clinical change. Advanced MRI techniques involving quantitative measures of diffuse damage in normal appearing (NA) white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) may help in resolving this apparent clinical MRI paradox. T2 hypointensity has been described in the GM of patients with MS and has been linked to physical disability, cognitive dysfunction, and brain atrophy. While this T2 hypointensity is thought to represent iron deposition, this awaits pathologic confirmation. Advanced MRI measures of iron deposition such as R2, R2*, R2' relaxometry, 3T imaging and other new approaches are beginning to be applied to studies of MS and should yield interesting information. Both T1 and T2 relaxometry have a role in detecting damage in NA brain tissue that escapes detection by conventional MRI lesion measures. For example, T2 mapping may allow an assessment of myelin content in NAWM. In this review, we will focus on MRI advances in the last 10 years pertaining to T1 and T2 measures of diffuse GM and WM damage.},

  abstract = {Renal tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia are key elements in the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury and its progression to chronic kidney disease. Yet, in vivo assessment of renal haemodynamics and tissue oxygenation remains a challenge. Many of the established approaches are invasive, hence not applicable in humans. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers an alternative. BOLD-MRI is non-invasive and indicative of renal tissue oxygenation. Nonetheless, recent (pre-) clinical studies revived the question as to how bold renal BOLD-MRI really is. This review aimed to deliver some answers. It is designed to inspire the renal physiology, nephrology and imaging communities to foster explorations into the assessment of renal oxygenation and haemodynamics by exploiting the powers of MRI. For this purpose, the specifics of renal oxygenation and perfusion are outlined. The fundamentals of BOLD-MRI are summarized. The link between tissue oxygenation and the oxygenation-sensitive MR biomarker is outlined. The merits and limitations of renal BOLD-MRI in animal and human studies are surveyed together with their clinical implications. Explorations into detailing the relation between renal and renal tissue partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) are discussed with a focus on factors confounding the vs. tissue pO2 relation. Multi-modality in vivo approaches suitable for detailing the role of the confounding factors that govern are considered. A schematic approach describing the link between renal perfusion, oxygenation, tissue compartments and renal is proposed. Future directions of MRI assessment of renal oxygenation and perfusion are explored.},

Materials and Methods The study included 15 matched pairs of renal transplant donors and recipients. ASL and BOLD MRI of the kidneys were performed on donors prior to transplant surgery (baseline) and on both donors and recipients at 3 months, 1 year and 2 years post-transplant. After 3 months, seven of the 15 recipients were prescribed 25\textendash 50 mg/day losartan for the remainder of the study. A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate perfusion, R2*, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) for changes across time or associated with losartan treatment. Results In donors, cortical perfusion in the remaining kidney decreased by 50 {$\pm$} 19 ml/min/100g (11.8\%) between baseline and 2 years (P {$<$} 0.05), while cortical R2* declined modestly by 0.7 {$\pm$} 0.3 s-1 (5.6\%; P {$<$} 0.05). In transplanted kidneys, cortical perfusion decreased markedly by 141 {$\pm$} 21 ml/min/100g (34.2\%) between baseline and 2 years (P {$<$} 0.001), while medullary R2* declined by 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.8 s-1 (8.3\%; P = 0.06). Single-kidney eGFR increased between baseline and 2 years by 17.7 {$\pm$} 2.7 ml/min/1.73m2 (40.3\%; P {$<$} 0.0001) in donors and to 14.6 {$\pm$} 4.3 ml/min/1.73m2 (33.3\%; P {$<$} 0.01) in recipients.

No significant effects of losartan were observed for any other markers of renal function. Conclusions The results suggest an important role for non-invasive functional monitoring with ASL and BOLD MRI in kidney transplant recipients and donors, and they indicate a potentially beneficial effect of losartan in recipients.},

  abstract = {Purpose To investigate the microscopic diffusion properties of formalin-fixed breast tissue. Methods Diffusion microimaging was performed at 16.4T with 40-{$\mu$}m isotropic voxels on two normal and two cancer tissue samples from four patients. Results were correlated with histology of the samples. Results Diffusion-weighted images and mean diffusivity maps demonstrated distinct diffusivity differences between breast tissue components. Mean diffusivity (MD) in normal tissue was 0.59 {$\pm$} 0.24 {$\mu$}m2/ms for gland lobule (voxels containing epithelium and intralobular stroma) and 1.23 {$\pm$} 0.34 {$\mu$}m2/ms for interlobular fibrous stroma. In the cancer samples, MD = 0.45 {$\pm$} 0.23 {$\mu$}m2/ms for invasive ductal carcinoma (voxels contain epithelium and intralobular stroma) and 0.61 {$\pm$} 0.35 {$\mu$}m2/ms for ductal carcinoma in situ. There were significant MD differences between all tissue components (P {$<$} 0.005), except between gland lobule and ductal carcinoma in situ (P = 0.71). The low diffusivity of epithelium-rich cancer tissue and of normal epithelium relative to its supporting fibrous stroma was similar to that reported for prostate tissue and the esophageal wall. Conclusion Diffusion microimaging demonstrates distinct diffusivity differences between breast tissue glandular structures. Low diffusivity may be a distinctive feature of mammalian epithelia.

  abstract = {Purpose:~The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging of the kidney at a field strength of 3T. We assessed fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) of various acquisition protocols and determined the reproducibility of these measurements. FA, ADC, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were compared with those acquired at 1.5T.         Material and Methods:~Ten healthy volunteers were examined with a respiratory-triggered echo-planar imaging sequence (TR: 1800 ms, TE: 58 ms, b = 0, 300 s/mm2) on a 3-Tesla whole-body MR scanner. Protocol variations included diffusion measurements during free-breathing, in 6 or 12 directions, and an additional b-value of 50 s/mm2. A breath-hold protocol was also integrated (TR: 820 ms, TE: 58 ms, b = 0, 300 s/mm2). Measurements with 2 b-values and 6 diffusion directions were also acquired at 1.5 T. SNR was calculated with the difference-image method. Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Intrareader correlation was assessed with weighted kappa coefficients and reproducibility with the root-mean-square-average and the Bland-Altman-method.         Results:~At 3T, SNR of cortex and medulla and CNR of cortex/medulla were significantly higher than at 1.5T, leading to improved corticomedullary discrimination. There were no significant FA- and ADC differences with 2 b-values and 6 diffusion directions between measurements at 1.5T and 3T. FA of the medulla was significantly higher than that of the cortex in all measurements. Tractography visualized a typical radial diffusion direction in the medulla. Best image quality was achieved with a respiratory triggered protocol with 12 acquisition directions. Measurements with 3 b-values led to decreased ADCs. Acquisition in 12 directions resulted in decreased cortical FA. FA and ADC of breath-hold and free-breathing acquisitions were significantly higher than that of the respiratory-triggered protocol. Intrareader correlation ranged from kappa 0.60 to 0.96. Variance of the respiratory-triggered protocol was smaller than that of breath-hold and free-breathing protocols. Variance was highest for medullary FA in all protocols with reproducibility coefficients ranging from 0.36 to 0.46.         Conclusion:~Diffusion tensor imaging of the kidney at 3T is feasible and yields significantly higher SNR and CNR. FA and ADCs do not significantly differ from 1.5T. Number of b-values influences ADC-values. Acquisitions in 12 directions provide lower cortical FA-values. We recommend a respiratory-triggered protocol because of improved image quality and reproducibility.},

  abstract = {Carr\textendash Purcell\textendash Meiboom\textendash Gill-based sequences are often assumed to be insensitive to diffusion. However, imaging gradients always contribute some degree of diffusion weighting which increases with resolution. This may cause an apparent decrease in T2 when using a multi-echo sequence, such as quantitative T2 (qT2) at high resolution. This study investigated the impact of diffusion on the qT2 sequence. An equation was developed relating the diffusion factor associated with each echo (bqT2) to the underestimation of T2, which was strongly dependent on both the actual T2 and the apparent diffusion coefficient of the tissue. The diffusion dependence of the measured T2 was demonstrated in rat spinal cord. The measured T2 was independent of the imaging plane in gray matter, where diffusion was isotropic, and orientation dependent in white matter, where diffusion was strongly anisotropic. The dependence of the measured T2 on the actual T2 value was also demonstrated in MnCl2 phantoms. The relationship between the resolution and underestimation of T2 was investigated both theoretically and experimentally for the original readout and a fully refocused readout. The fully refocused readout increased the resolution at which diffusion effects could be neglected whilst measuring T2. To avoid the misidentification of cerebrospinal fluid when applying qT2 in the brain or spinal cord, a minimum in-plane voxel dimension of 0.2 mm was suggested for the standard qT2 sequence and 0.1 mm for the refocused readout. Simulations of myelin water fraction measurement indicated that signal-to-noise ratio requirements were increased in the presence of diffusion. Finally, the use of decreasing spoiler gradients to attenuate stimulated echoes should be avoided, as it was found to distort the T2 distribution when the slice thickness was less than 1 mm.

No significant change in R\,*2 occurred following pure oxygen in any organ.

In DTI measurements, 2 motion-probing gradient (MPG) pulses are applied to evaluate water diffusion. In DTI for nerve fiber tracking, acquisition parameters, such as strength, duration, and separation of MPGs, influence the MR signal. In this study, we set acquisition parameters in DTI to emphasize fractional anisotropy to clarify the direction of nerve fibers. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of restricted diffusion in a cylinder model and phantom measurements with capillary plates to examine the relationship between the acquisition parameters in DTI and the size of restricted structures, particularly their diameter and length, which we will refer to as "compartment size." We confirmed that normalized signal intensities in DTI measurements depend on diffusion time, which, in turn, depends on the separation and duration of the MPG, and they decrease with increase in compartment size. Furthermore, our simulation and phantom results suggest that use of a longer diffusion time effectively emphasizes fractional anisotropy to clarify the direction of nerve fibers.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion imaging provides a valuable tool used for inferring structural anisotropy of brain white matter connectivity from diffusion tensor imaging. Recently, several high angular resolution diffusion models were introduced in order to overcome the inadequacy of the tensor model for describing fibre crossing within a single voxel. Among them, q-ball imaging (QBI), inherited from the q-space method, relies on a spherical Radon transform providing a direct relationship between the diffusion-weighted MR signal and the orientation distribution function (ODF). Experimental validation of these methods in a model system is necessary to determine the accuracy of the methods and to optimize them. A diffusion phantom made up of two textile rayon fibre (comparable in diameter to axons) bundles, crossing at 90\textdegree, was designed and dedicated to ex vivo q-ball validation on a clinical scanner. Normalized ODFs were calculated inside regions of interest corresponding to monomodal and bimodal configurations of underlying structures. Three-dimensional renderings of ODFs revealed monomodal shapes for voxels containing single-fibre population and bimodal patterns for voxels located within the crossing area. Principal orientations were estimated from ODFs and were compared with a priori structural fibre directions, validating efficiency of QBI for depicting fibre crossing. In the homogeneous regions, QBI detected the fibre angle with an accuracy of 19\textdegree{} and in the fibre-crossing region with an accuracy of 30\textdegree.},

To clarify the basis of abnormal diffusion in TSC, we correlated ex vivo high-resolution diffusion imaging with histopathology in four tissue types: cortex, tuber, perituber, and white matter. Methods Surgical specimens of three children with TSC were scanned in a 3T or 7T MRI with a structural image isotropic resolution of 137\textendash 300 micron, and diffusion image isotropic resolution of 270-1,000 micron. We stained for myelin (luxol fast blue, LFB), gliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP), and neurons (NeuN) and registered the digitized histopathology slides (0.686 micron resolution) to MRI for visual comparison. We then performed colocalization analysis in four tissue types in each specimen. Finally, we applied a linear mixed model (LMM) for pooled analysis across the three specimens. Results In white matter and perituber regions, LFB optical density measures correlated with fractional anisotropy (FA) and inversely with mean diffusivity (MD). In white matter only, GFAP correlated with MD, and inversely with FA. In tubers and in the cortex, there was little variation in mean LFB and GFAP signal intensity, and no correlation with MRI metrics. Neuronal density correlated with MD. In the analysis of the combined specimens, the most robust correlation was between white matter MD and LFB metrics. Interpretation In TSC, diffusion imaging abnormalities in microscopic tissue types correspond to specific histopathological markers. Across all specimens, white matter diffusivity correlates with myelination.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that functional MRI (fMRI) can be sensitive to the laminar and columnar organization of the cortex based on differences in the spatial and temporal characteristics of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal originating from the macrovasculature and the neuronal-specific microvasculature. Human fMRI studies at this scale of the cortical architecture, however, are very rare because the high spatial/temporal resolution required to explore these properties of the BOLD signal are limited by the signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we show that it is possible to detect BOLD signal changes at an isotropic spatial resolution as high as 0.55 mm at 7 T using a high-density multi-element surface coil with minimal electronics, which allows close proximity to the head. The coil comprises of very small, 1\,\texttimes\,2-cm2, elements arranged in four flexible modules of four elements each (16-channel) that can be positioned within 1 mm from the head. As a result of this proximity, tissue losses were five-fold greater than coil losses and sufficient to exclude preamplifier decoupling. When compared with a standard 16-channel head coil, the BOLD sensitivity was approximately 2.2-fold higher for a high spatial/temporal resolution (1 mm isotropic/0.4 s), multi-slice, echo planar acquisition, and approximately three- and six-fold higher for three-dimensional echo planar images acquired with isotropic resolutions of 0.7 and 0.55 mm, respectively. Improvements in parallel imaging performance (geometry factor) were up to around 1.5-fold with increasing acceleration factor, and improvements in fMRI detectability (temporal signal-to-noise ratio) were up to around four-fold depending on the distance to the coil. Although deeper lying structures may not benefit from the design, most fMRI questions pertain to the neocortex which lies within approximately 4 cm from the surface. These results suggest that the resolution of fMRI (at 7 T) can approximate levels that are closer to the spatial/temporal scale of the fundamental functional organization of the human cortex using a simple high-density coil design for high sensitivity.

Super-resolution techniques could have strong impacts on structural magnetic resonance imaging when focusing on cortical surface or fine-scale structure analysis for instance. In this paper, we study deep three-dimensional convolutional neural networks for the super-resolution of brain magnetic resonance imaging data. First, our work delves into the relevance of several factors in the performance of the purely convolutional neural network-based techniques for the monomodal super-resolution: optimization methods, weight initialization, network depth, residual learning, filter size in convolution layers, number of the filters, training patch size and number of training subjects. Second, our study also highlights that one single network can efficiently handle multiple arbitrary scaling factors based on a multiscale training approach. Third, we further extend our super-resolution networks to the multimodal super-resolution using intermodality priors. Fourth, we investigate the impact of transfer learning skills onto super-resolution performance in terms of generalization among different datasets. Lastly, the learnt models are used to enhance real clinical low-resolution images. Results tend to demonstrate the potential of deep neural networks with respect to practical medical image applications.},

Methods and Materials This is an analysis of a phase 1 trial of stereotactic body radiation therapy for primary inoperable renal cell carcinoma. A dose of 42~Gy/3 fractions was prescribed to targets {$\geq$}5~cm, whereas for {$<$}5~cm 26~Gy/1 fraction was used. All patients underwent a planning 4-dimensional CT to generate a planning target volume (PTV) from a 5-mm isotropic expansion of the internal target volume. Planning required a minimum of 8 fields prescribing to the minimum isodose surrounding the PTV. Intermediate dose spillage at 50\% of the prescription dose (R50\%) was measured to describe the dose gradient. Early toxicity ({$<$}6~months) was scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v4.0). Results From July 2012 to August 2013 a total of 20 patients (median age, 77~years) were recruited into a prospective clinical trial. Eleven patients underwent fractionated treatment and 9 patients a single fraction. For PTV targets {$<$}100~cm3 the median number of beams used was 8 (2 noncoplanar) to achieve an average R50\% of 3.7. For PTV targets {$>$}100~cm3 the median beam number used was 10 (4 noncoplanar) for an average R50\% value of 4.3. The R50\% was inversely proportional to decreasing PTV volume (r=-0.62, P=.003) and increasing total beams used (r=-0.51, P=.022). Twelve of 20 patients (60\%) suffered grade {$\leq$}2 early toxicity, whereas 8 of 20 patients (40\%) were asymptomatic. Nausea, chest wall pain, and fatigue were the most common toxicities reported. Conclusion A 3-dimensional conformal planning technique of 8-10 beams can be used to deliver highly tolerable stereotactic ablation to primary kidney targets with minimal early toxicities. Ongoing follow-up is currently in place to assess long-term toxicities and cancer control.},

  abstract = {Objectives To assess inter-observer variability of renal blood oxygenation level-dependent MRI (BOLD-MRI) using a new method of analysis, called the concentric objects (CO) technique, in comparison with the classical ROI (region of interest)-based technique. Methods MR imaging (3T) was performed before and after furosemide in 10 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients (mean eGFR 43{$\pm$}24ml/min/1.73m2) and 10 healthy volunteers (eGFR 101{$\pm$}28ml/min1.73m2), and R2* maps were determined on four coronal slices. In the CO-technique, R2* values were based on a semi-automatic procedure that divided each kidney in six equal layers, whereas in the ROI-technique, all circles (ROIs) were placed manually in the cortex and medulla. The mean R2*values as assessed by two independent investigators were compared. Results With the CO-technique, inter-observer variability was 0.7\%\textendash 1.9\% across all layers in non-CKD, versus 1.6\%\textendash 3.8\% in CKD. With the ROI-technique, median variability for cortical and medullary R2* values was 3.6 and 6.8\% in non-CKD, versus 4.7 and 12.5\% in CKD; similar results were observed after furosemide. Conclusion The CO-technique offers a new, investigator-independent, highly reproducible alternative to the ROI-based technique to estimate renal tissue oxygenation in CKD.},

  abstract = {Single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) is well established as the method of choice for clinical, diffusion-weighted imaging with MRI because of its low sensitivity to the motion-induced phase errors that occur during diffusion sensitization of the MR signal. However, the method is prone to artifacts due to susceptibility changes at tissue interfaces and has a limited spatial resolution. The introduction of parallel imaging techniques, such as GRAPPA (GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions), has reduced these problems, but there are still significant limitations, particularly at higher field strengths, such as 3 Tesla (T), which are increasingly being used for routine clinical imaging. This study describes how the combination of readout-segmented EPI and parallel imaging can be used to address these issues by generating high-resolution, diffusion-weighted images at 1.5T and 3T with a significant reduction in susceptibility artifact compared with the single-shot case. The technique uses data from a 2D navigator acquisition to perform a nonlinear phase correction and to control the real-time reacquisition of unusable data that cannot be corrected. Measurements on healthy volunteers demonstrate that this approach provides a robust correction for motion-induced phase artifact and allows scan times that are suitable for routine clinical application.

  abstract = {Changes in renal medullary pO2 during water diuresis as evaluated by blood oxygenation level\textendash dependent magnetic resonance imaging: Effects of aging and cyclooxygenase inhibition. Background. Hypoxia of the renal medulla has been implicated in the development of renal injury, particularly acute renal failure, and its regulation in humans may therefore be relevant to certain renal disorders. Changes in oxygenation of the renal medulla can now be monitored noninvasively with blood oxygenation level\textendash dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using this method, water diuresis has been shown to improve medullary oxygenation in young persons. Urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) likewise increases during water diuresis in younger but not in older people. We used BOLD MRI to measure the effects of aging and of inhibiting prostaglandin synthetase on the renal response to water diuresis in healthy human subjects. Methods. Nine younger (25 to 31 years) and nine older (59 to 79 years) female volunteers were studied with BOLD MRI during antidiuresis in the postabsorptive state and during water diuresis. Simultaneously, urinary excretion of PGE2 was determined. PG synthetase was inhibited by administering ibuprofen. Results. Renal medullary oxygenation, initially low, greatly improved during diuresis in younger subjects, whereas PGE2 excretion increased. In older women, however, water diuresis elicited no change in oxygenation of renal medulla or PGE2 excretion. Ibuprofen inhibited excretion of PGE2 and blocked the increase in medullary oxygenation normally produced by water diuresis in the young. Conclusions. The increase in oxygenation of the renal medulla accompanying water diuresis depends on PGE2 synthesis. Attenuation of renal PGE2 synthesis in older people is probably responsible, at least in part, for the loss of the ability to improve medullary oxygenation that younger subjects possess. Inability to improve renal medullary oxygenation might predispose to hypoxic renal injury in older patients.},

In an animal model, inhibition of the synthesis of nitric oxide and prostaglandins appears to predispose rats to severe renal injury following the administration of radiocontrast. Here we have investigated whether administration of radiocontrast, as well as changes in renal medullary oxygenation following pharmacologic inhibition of nitric oxide and prostaglandin synthesis, might be evaluated by blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI. Nineteen anesthetized (Inactin 100 mg/kg) rats were studied. BOLD MRI measurements were performed following administration of L-NAME (N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, 10 mg/kg), Indomethacin (10 mg/kg), and a radiocontrast agent (sodium iothalamate 60\%, 6 mL/kg). Marked sequential changes in medullary R\,*2, presumably reflecting decline in medullary pO2, were noted after each of the pharmacological interventions employed. These results, obtained by noninvasive MRI, are consistent with prior direct recordings of pO2 and doppler flow in the rat renal medulla after administration of L-NAME, Indomethacin and iothalamate. Medullary oxygenation in rats was reduced by inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins and nitric oxide, as well as by intravenous injection of radiocontrast agents.

Exploration of the pathophysiological implications of medullary hypoxia has been hampered by the absence of a noninvasive technique to estimate intrarenal oxygenation in different zones of the kidney. In the present study, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a method on the basis of blood oxygenation level\textendash dependent (BOLD) MRI, which allows sequential measurements in humans in response to a variety of physiological/pharmacological stimuli in health and disease.Methods and Results BOLD MRI measurements were obtained in healthy young human subjects (n=7), and the effects of three different pharmacological/physiological maneuvers that induce diuresis were studied. Spin-spin relaxation rate, R2*, was measured, which is directly related to the amount of deoxyhemoglobin in blood and in turn to tissue Po2. Furosemide but not acetazolamide (n=6 each) increased medullary oxygenation ({$\Delta$}R2*=7.62 Hz; P{$<$}.01), consistent with the separate sites of action of these diuretics in the nephron and with previous direct measurements of their effects in anesthetized rats with oxygen microelectrodes. A new finding is that water diuresis improves medullary oxygenation ({$\Delta$}R2*=6.43 Hz; P{$<$}.01) in young human subjects (n=5).Conclusions BOLD MRI can be used to monitor changes in intrarenal oxygenation in humans in a noninvasive fashion.},

  abstract = {New, efficient reconstruction procedures are proposed for sensitivity encoding (SENSE) with arbitrary k-space trajectories. The presented methods combine gridding principles with so-called conjugate-gradient iteration. In this fashion, the bulk of the work of reconstruction can be performed by fast Fourier transform (FFT), reducing the complexity of data processing to the same order of magnitude as in conventional gridding reconstruction. Using the proposed method, SENSE becomes practical with nonstandard k-space trajectories, enabling considerable scan time reduction with respect to mere gradient encoding. This is illustrated by imaging simulations with spiral, radial, and random k-space patterns. Simulations were also used for investigating the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm and its dependence on the factor by which gradient encoding is reduced. The in vivo feasibility of non-Cartesian SENSE imaging with iterative reconstruction is demonstrated by examples of brain and cardiac imaging using spiral trajectories. In brain imaging with six receiver coils, the number of spiral interleaves was reduced by factors ranging from 2 to 6. In cardiac real-time imaging with four coils, spiral SENSE permitted reducing the scan time per image from 112 ms to 56 ms, thus doubling the frame-rate.

Thus, by using multiple receiver coils in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and k-space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one-half using a two-coil array in brain imaging.

  abstract = {BOLD-MRI (blood oxygenation-level dependent magnetic resonance imaging) allows non-invasive measurement of renal tissue oxygenation in humans, without the need for contrast products. BOLD-MRI uses the fact that magnetic properties of hemoglobin depend of its oxygenated state:: the higher local deoxyhemoglobin, the higher the so called apparent relaxation rate R2* (sec-1), and the lower local tissue oxygen content. Several factors other than deoxyhemoglobin (such as hydration status, dietary sodium intake, and susceptibility effects) influence the BOLD signal, and need to be taken into account when interpreting results. The last 5 years have witnessed important improvements in the standardization of these factors, and the appearance of new, highly reproducible analysis techniques of BOLD-images, that are reviewed in this article. Using these new BOLD-MRI analysis techniques, it has recently been shown that persons suffering from chronic kidney diseases (CKD) have lower cortical oxygenation than normotensive controls, thus confirming the chronic hypoxia hypothesis. The acute alterations in R2* after the administration of furosemide are smaller in CKD, and represent an estimate of the oxygen-dependent tubular transport of sodium. BOLD-MRI-alone or in combination with other functional MRI methods- can be used to monitor the renal effects of drugs, and is increasingly used in the preclinical setting. The near future will tell whether or not BOLD-MRI represents a new tool to predict renal function decline an adverse renal outcome.},

To this purpose, we measured renal hemodynamics, renal sodium handling, and renal oxygenation in normotensive (NT) and hypertensive (HT) subjects after 1 week of a high-sodium and 1 week of a low-sodium diet. Renal oxygenation was measured using blood oxygen level\textendash dependent magnetic resonance. Tissue oxygenation was determined by the measurement of R2* maps on 4 coronal slices covering both kidneys. The mean R2* values in the medulla and cortex were calculated, with a low R2* indicating a high tissue oxygenation. Ten male NT (mean age: 26.5{$\pm$}7.4 years) and 8 matched HT subjects (mean age: 28.8{$\pm$}5.7 years) were studied. Cortical R2* was not different under the 2 conditions of salt intake. Medullary R2* was significantly lower under low sodium than high sodium in both NT and HT subjects (28.1{$\pm$}0.8 versus 31.3{$\pm$}0.6 s-1; P{$<$}0.05 in NT; and 27.9{$\pm$}1.5 versus 30.3{$\pm$}0.8 s-1; P{$<$}0.05, in HT), indicating higher medullary oxygenation under low-sodium conditions. In NT subjects, medullary oxygenation was positively correlated with proximal reabsorption of sodium and negatively with absolute distal sodium reabsorption, but not with renal plasma flow. In HT subjects, medullary oxygenation correlated with the 24-hour sodium excretion but not with proximal or with the distal handling of sodium. These data demonstrate that dietary sodium intake influences renal tissue oxygenation, low sodium intake leading to an increased renal medullary oxygenation both in normotensive and young hypertensive subjects.},

Materials and MethodsEthical permission was given by the University College London hospital ethics committee, and informed written consent was obtained from all participants. Preoperative MR imaging was performed in 18 consecutive patients with Crohn disease undergoing elective small-bowel resection. The Harvey-Bradshaw index, the C-reactive protein level, and disease chronicity were recorded. The resected bowel was retrospectively identified at preoperative MR imaging, and wall thickness, mural and lymph node/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal intensity ratios on T2-weighted fat-saturated images, gadolinium-based contrast material uptake, enhancement pattern, and mesenteric signal intensity on T2-weighted fat-saturated images were recorded. Precise histologic matching was achieved by imaging the ex vivo surgical specimens. Histopathologic grading of acute inflammation with the acute inflammatory score (AIS) (on the basis of mucosal ulceration, edema, and quantity and depth of neutrophilic infiltration) and the degree of fibrostenosis was performed at each site, and results were compared with MR imaging features. Data were analyzed by using linear regression with robust standard errors of the estimate. ResultsAIS was positively correlated with mural thickness and mural/CSF signal intensity ratio on T2-weighted fat-saturated images (P {$<$} .001 and P = .003, respectively) but not with mural enhancement at 30 and 70 seconds (P = .50 and P = .73, respectively). AIS was higher with layered mural enhancement (P {$<$} .001), a pattern also commonly associated with coexisting fibrostenosis (75\%). Mural/CSF signal intensity ratio on T2-weighted fat-saturated images was higher in histologically edematous bowel than in nonedematous bowel (P = .04). There was no correlation between any lymph node characteristic and AIS. ConclusionIncreasing mural thickness, high mural signal intensity on T2-weighted fat-saturated images, and a layered pattern of enhancement reflect histologic features of acute small-bowel inflammation in Crohn disease.Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/radiol.2523082167/DC1\textcopyright{} RSNA, 2009},

Quantitative 9.4T MRI was carried out (T1, T2, T2* and magnetization transfer ratio) on 13 cortical resections, representing pathologically confirmed FCD (five cases) and normal cortex. Quantitative immunohistochemistry for myelination (myelin basic protein/SMI94), neuronal populations [microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), neurofilament (SMI31, SMI32), synaptophysin, NeuN, calbindin], reactive glia (GFAP), microglia (CD68) and blood\textendash brain barrier permeability (albumin) was carried out in 43 regions of interest (ROI) from normal and abnormal white matter and cortex. MRI was spatially aligned and quantitative analysis carried out on corresponding ROI. Line profile analysis (LPA) of intensity gradients through the cortex was carried out on MRI and immunostained sections. An inverse correlation was noted between myelin/SMI94 and T1, T2 (P {$<$} 0.005) and T2* (P {$<$} 0.05; Spearman's correlation) and a positive correlation between neuronal MAP2 and T1 (P {$<$} 0.005) and T2* (P {$<$} 0.05) over all ROI. Similar pathology\textendash MRI correlations were observed for histologically unremarkable white matter ROI only. LPA showed altered gradient contours in regions of FCD, reflecting abnormal cortical lamination and myelo-architecture, including a preoperatively undetected FCD case. This study demonstrates the ability of quantitative 9.4T MRI to detect subtle differences in neuronal numbers and myelination in histologically normal appearing white matter and LPA in the evaluation of cortical dyslamination.

  abstract = {Purpose To evaluate renal allografts function early after transplantation using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. Methods This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. A total of 82 participants with 62 renal allograft recipients (2\textendash 4weeks after kidney transplantation) and 20 volunteers were enrolled to be scanned using IVIM and ASL MRI on a 3.0T MR scanner. Recipients were divided into two groups with either normal or impaired function according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with a threshold of 60ml/min/1.73m2. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of pure diffusion (ADCslow), the ADC of pseudodiffusion (ADCfast), perfusion fraction (PF), and renal blood flow (RBF) of cortex were compared among three groups. The correlation of ADCslow, ADCfast, PF and RBF with eGFR was evaluated. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the diagnostic efficiency of using IVIM and ASL parameters to discriminate allografts with impaired function from normal function. P{$<$}0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results In allografts with normal function, no significant difference of mean cortical ADCslow, ADCfast, and PF was found compared with healthy controls (P{$>$}0.05). Cortical RBF in allografts with normal function was statistically lower than that of healthy controls (P{$<$}0.001). Mean cortical ADCslow, ADCfast, PF and RBF were lower for allografts with impaired function than that with normal function (P{$<$}0.05). Mean cortical ADCslow, ADCfast, PF and RBF showed a positive correlation with eGFR (all P{$<$}0.01) for recipients. The combination of IVIM and ASL MRI showed a higher area under the ROC curve (AUC) (0.865) than that of ASL MRI alone (P=0.02). Conclusion Combined IVIM and ASL MRI can better evaluate the diffusion and perfusion properties for allografts early after kidney transplantation.},

The fractional anisotropy (FA) of the cortex and the medulla were found to be 0.22 {$\pm$} 0.12 and 0.39 {$\pm$} 0.11, respectively (N = 10), which emphasizes the need for rotationally invariant diffusion measurements for clinical applications. Additional limitations for clinical diffusion imaging on the kidney are the strong susceptibility variations within the abdomen that restrict the use of imaging techniques employing long echo trains, and the severe motion sensitivity that limits the available imaging time to one breath-hold. To overcome these problems an isotropic, diffusion-weighted, segmented EPI protocol that facilitates the acquisition of high-resolution diffusion-weighted images within a single breath-hold was implemented. Using this method, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the cortex and medulla were found to be 2.89 {$\pm$} 0.28 {$\cdot$} 10-9 m2/s and 2.18 {$\pm$} 0.36 {$\cdot$} 10-9 m2/s (N = 10). J.

The aim of this study was to characterize the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings that are differentially associated with the presence of fibrosis and those associated with inflammatory activity, using the pathological analysis of surgically resected intestinal lesions as reference standard.Methods:MRI studies with identical imaging protocol of 41 CD patients who underwent elective bowel resection within 4 months before surgery were reviewed. MRI evaluated wall thickening, edema, ulcers, signal intensity at submucosa at 70 s and 7 min after gadolinium injection, stenosis, and pattern of enhancement in each phase of the dynamic study and changes on this pattern over time. Pathological inflammatory and fibrosis scores were classified into three grades of severity.Results:In all, 44 segments from 41 patients were analyzed. The pathological intensity of inflammation was associated with the following MRI parameters: hypersignal on T2 (P=0.02), mucosal enhancement (P=0.03), ulcerations (P=0.01), and blurred margins (P=0.05). The degree of fibrosis correlated with the percentage of enhancement gain (P{$<$}0.01), the pattern of enhancement at 7 min (P{$<$}0.01), and the presence of stenosis (P=0.05). Using percentage of enhancement gain, MRI is able to discriminate between mild\textendash moderate and severe fibrosis deposition with a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.89.Conclusions:MRI is accurate for detecting the presence of severe fibrosis in CD lesions on the basis of the enhancement pattern.},

  abstract = {The pathological changes in 50 percutaneous renal-biopsy specimens from patients with persistent glomerular nephritis have been analysed. Techniques were developed which allowed glomerular and tubular lesions to be assessed quantitatively. A highly significant correlation was found between the extent of tubular damage and creatinine clearance, plasma-creatinine, and the ability to concentrate and to acidify the urine. A less significant correlation was found between the extent of the structural changes in the glomeruli and creatinine clearance, plasma-creatinine, and the ability to concentrate the urine. In some patients with inconspicuous glomerular changes but severe tubular damage, the creatinine clearance was grossly reduced; conversely, in some patients with extensive glomerular changes but little or no tubular damage, the creatinine clearances were normal. It is concluded that in persistent glomerular nephritis the glomerular filtration-rate is more affected by changes in the tubules than by changes in the glomeruli. Degenerative changes in the renal arterioles tended to occur significantly more often with increasing age and with increasing diastolic blood-pressure. The severity of the structural changes in the glomeruli correlated significantly with the presence of hyaline arteriolar change; the extent of tubular atrophy correlated significantly with the presence of fibroelastic intimal hyperplasia.},

The point spread function is difficult to measure precisely in magnetic resonance even with the use of carefully designed phantoms, and it is difficult to calculate this function for complex sequences such as echo-planar imaging. This report describes a method that measures the point spread function with high spatial resolution at each pixel in samples of uniform intensity distribution. This method uses additional phase encoding gradients before the echo-planar acquisition that are constant in length but vary in amplitude. The additional gradients are applied to image the contents within each individual voxel. This method has been used to measure the point spread function for echo-planar imaging to demonstrate the effects of limited k-space sampling and transverse relaxation, as well as the effects of object motion. By considering the displacement of the point spread function, local distortions due to susceptibility and chemical shift effects have been quantified and corrected. The method allows rapid assessment of the point spread function in echo-planar imaging, in vivo, and may also be applied to other rapid imaging sequences that can be modified to include these additional phase encoding gradients.},

  abstract = {We describe methods for simultaneously acquiring and subsequently combining data from a multitude of closely positioned NMR receiving coils. The approach is conceptually similar to phased array radar and ultrasound and hence we call our techniques the ``NMR phased array.'' The NMR phased array offers the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and resolution of a small surface coil over fields-of-view (FOV) normally associated with body imaging with no increase in imaging time. The NMR phased array can be applied to both imaging and spectroscopy for all pulse sequences. The problematic interactions among nearby surface coils is eliminated (a) by overlapping adjacent coils to give zero mutual inductance, hence zero interaction, and (b) by attaching low input impedance preamplifiers to all coils, thus eliminating interference among next nearest and more distant neighbors. We derive an algorithm for combining the data from the phased array elements to yield an image with optimum SNR. Other techniques which are easier to implement at the cost of lower SNR are explored. Phased array imaging is demonstrated with high resolution (512 \texttimes{} 512, 48-cm FOV, and 32-cm FOV) spin-echo images of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Data were acquired from four-element linear spine arrays, the first made of 12-cm square coils and the second made of 8-cm square coils. When compared with images from a single 15 \texttimes{} 30-cm rectangular coil and identical imaging parameters, the phased array yields a 2X and 3X higher SNR at the depth of the spine ( {$\sim$} 7 cm). \textcopyright{} 1990 Academic Press, Inc.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

The potential diagnostic value of a detailed histogram analysis of such perfusion data for detection of mild renal dysfunction was investigated.         Materials and Methods~         Eight healthy volunteers and 9 patients with mild renal dysfunction (chronic kidney disease stages 1-3) were included in the study. All subjects underwent ASL perfusion measurements with a 1.5-T magnetic resonance scanner using a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery labeling scheme with true fast imaging in steady-state precession data readout. Quantitative perfusion maps were generated using extended Bloch equations. Histogram analysis was performed to quantify the metrics of the perfusion of the renal cortex and the entire parenchyma, respectively. Mean perfusion value ({$\mu$}), SD of the mean value ({$\sigma$}), peak height (PH), peak position (PP), skewness (s), and kurtosis (k) were computed to describe the distribution of the perfusion values.         Results~         A significant difference was found in the mean perfusion values computed for the cortex and the parenchyma between healthy volunteers (cortex, 329 {$\pm$} 53 mL/100 g/min; parenchyma, 301 {$\pm$} 51 mL/100 g/min) and patients (cortex, 263 {$\pm$} 81 mL/100 g/min; parenchyma, 244 {$\pm$} 77 mL/100 g/min). The histogram analysis of the cortical perfusion values also showed a significant difference (P {$<$} 0.05) in the main histogram measures between healthy volunteers (PP = 368 {$\pm$} 65 mL/100 g/min; s = -0.543 {$\pm$} 0.298; k = 0.371 {$\pm$} 0.590) and patients (PP = 237 {$\pm$} 115 mL/100 g/min; s = -0.125 {$\pm$} 0.581; k = -0.151 {$\pm$} 0.561).         Conclusion~         Moderate renal dysfunction is associated with a significant change in the distribution of cortical perfusion values and a reduction of blood perfusion for both the parenchyma and the cortex. The preliminary results reported in this study suggest the importance of a regional assessment of renal perfusion. Histogram analysis of ASL data may help to detect chronic kidney disorders and to monitor their progression in a clinical setting.},

METHODS: T2 maps were calculated, and individual patients were compared with a group of 30 control subjects using SPM. RESULTS: T2 mapping and objective voxel-by-voxel statistical comparison identified regions of increased T2 signal in all 14 patients with acquired nonprogressive cerebral lesions and partial seizures. In all of these, the areas of increased T2 signal concurred with abnormalities identified on visual inspection of conventional MRI. In 18 of 20 patients with MCDs, SPM detected regions of increased T2 signal, all of which corresponded to abnormalities identified on visual inspection of conventional MRI. In addition, in both groups, there were areas that were normal on conventional imaging, which demonstrated abnormal T2 signal. Voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis identified increased T2 signal in 23 of the 45 patients with cryptogenic focal epilepsy. In 20 of these, the areas of increased T2 signal concurred with epileptiform EEG abnormality and clinical seizure semiology. Group analysis of MRI-negative patients with electroclinical seizure onset localizing to the left and right temporal and left and right frontal regions revealed increased T2 signal within the white matter of each respective lobe. CONCLUSIONS: T2 mapping analyzed using statistical parametric mapping was sensitive in patients with malformations of cortical development and acquired cerebral damage. Increased T2 signal in individual and grouped MRI-negative patients suggests that minor structural abnormalities exist in occult epileptogenic cerebral lesions.},

  abstract = {Purpose To determine the relationship between parameters measured from luminal water imaging (LWI), a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 mapping technique, and the corresponding tissue composition in prostate. Materials and Methods In all, 17 patients with prostate cancer were examined with a 3D multiecho spin echo sequence at 3T prior to undergoing radical prostatectomy. Maps of seven MR parameters, called N, T2-short, T2-long, Ashort, Along, geometric mean T2 time (gmT2), and luminal water fraction (LWF), were generated using nonnegative least squares (NNLS) analysis of the T2 decay curves. MR parametric maps were correlated to digitized whole-mount histology sections. Percentage area of tissue components, including luminal space, nuclei, and cytoplasm plus stroma, was measured on the histology sections by using color-based image segmentation. Spearman's rank correlation test was used to evaluate the correlation between MR parameters and the corresponding tissue components, with particular attention paid to the correlation between LWF and percentage area of luminal space. Results N, T2-short, Along, gmT2, and LWF showed significant correlation (P {$<$} 0.05) with percentage area of luminal space and stroma plus cytoplasm. T2-short and gmT2 also showed significant correlation (P {$<$} 0.05) with percentage area of nuclei. Overall, the strongest correlation was observed between LWF and luminal space (Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation = 0.75, P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion Results of this study show that LWF measured with MRI is strongly correlated with the fractional amount of luminal space in prostatic tissue. This result suggests that LWI can potentially be applied for evaluation of prostatic diseases in which the extent of luminal space differs between normal and abnormal tissues.

  abstract = {Objectives In human chronic kidney disease (CKD) the extent of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis correlates with progressive loss of renal function. However, fibrosis can so far only be assessed by histology of kidney biopsies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information about tissue architecture, but its potential to assess fibrosis and inflammation in diseased kidneys remains poorly defined. Materials and methods We evaluated excised kidneys in a murine adenine-induced nephropathy model for CKD by MRI and correlated quantitative MRI parameters (T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy) with histological hallmarks of progressive CKD, including renal fibrosis, inflammation, and microvascular rarefaction. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of paraformaldehyde fixation on MRI parameters by comparing kidney samples before and after fixation with paraformaldehyde. Results In diseased kidneys T2 and T2* relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy in the renal cortex and/or outer medulla were significantly different from those in control kidneys. In particular, T2 relaxation time was the best parameter to distinguish control and CKD groups and correlated very well with the extent of fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrates, tubular dilation, crystal deposition, and loss of peritubular capillaries and normal tubules in the renal cortex and outer medulla. Fixation with paraformaldehyde had no impact on T2 relaxation time and fractional anisotropy, whereas T1 times significantly decreased and T2* times and apparent diffusion coefficients increased in fixed kidney tissue. Conclusions MRI parameters provide a promising approach to quantitatively assess renal fibrosis and inflammation in CKD. Especially T2 relaxation time correlates well with histological features of CKD and is not influenced by paraformaldehyde fixation of kidney samples. Thus, T2 relaxation time might be a candidate parameter for non-invasive assessment of renal fibrosis in human patients.},

Following fixation T1, T2 (NAWM, WML) and MTR (NAWM) dropped, whereas fB (NAWM, WML) increased. Compared to published in vivo data all diffusivity measures were lower in unfixed MS brain, and dropped further following fixation (except for FA). MTR was the best predictor of Tmyelin (inversely related to myelin) in unfixed MS brain (r = -0.83; P {$<$} 0.01) whereas postfixation T2 (r = 0.92; P {$<$} 0.01), T1 (r = 0.89; P {$<$} 0.01), and fB (r = -0.86; P {$<$} 0.01) were superior. All diffusivity measures (except for Dax in unfixed tissue) were predictors of myelin content. Magn Reson Med 59:268\textendash 277, 2008. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Underlying pathologic and MRI characteristics of DAWM are largely unknown.To explore and describe the histopathologic and radiologic characteristics of DAWM in chronic MS.An MRI and histopathologic postmortem correlative study.We analyzed 17 formalin-fixed hemispheric brain slices from 10 patients with chronic MS using histopathologic analysis and qualitative and quantitative MRI. A region-of-interest approach was applied to compare radiologically defined DAWM, normal-appearing WM, and focal WM lesions and to correlate quantitative MRI measures with histopathologic findings.The DAWM consisted of extensive axonal loss, decreased myelin density, and chronic fibrillary gliosis, all of which were substantially abnormal compared with normal-appearing WM and significantly different from focal WM lesion pathology. Increased T1- and T2-relaxation times and decreased fractional anisotropy values were found in DAWM regions of interest, in association with extensive axonal loss and reduced myelin density. Increased T1- and T2-relaxation times were associated with chronic gliosis.This study classifies DAWM in chronic MS as an abnormality that is different from normal-appearing WM and focal WM lesions, most likely resulting from the cumulative effects of ongoing inflammation and axonal pathology. As such, DAWM is likely to substantially contribute to disease progression and may prove to be an important new disease marker in clinical trials focusing on the neurodegenerative aspects of MS.Arch Neurol. 2009;66(5):601-609--{$>$}},

We will review how recent studies are attempting to verify the accuracy of laminar fMRI by recreating the known laminar profiles of various neural tuning properties. Furthermore, we will examine how feedforward and feedback-related neural processes engage different cortical layers, producing canonical patterns of spiking and synaptic activity as estimated by the analysis of current-source density. These results provide a benchmark for recent studies aiming to examine the profiles of bottom-up and top-down processes with laminar fMRI.

  abstract = {Several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrasts are sensitive to myelin content in gray matter in vivo which has ignited ambitions of MRI-based in vivo cortical histology. Ultra-high field (UHF) MRI, at fields of 7T and beyond, is crucial to provide the resolution and contrast needed to sample contrasts over the depth of the cortex and get closer to layer resolved imaging. Ex vivo MRI of human post mortem samples is an important stepping stone to investigate MRI contrast in the cortex, validate it against histology techniques applied in situ to the same tissue, and investigate the resolutions needed to translate ex vivo findings to in vivo UHF MRI. Here, we investigate key technology to extend such UHF studies to large human brain samples while maintaining high resolution, which allows investigation of the layered architecture of several cortical areas over their entire 3D extent and their complete borders where architecture changes. A 16 channel cylindrical phased array radiofrequency (RF) receive coil was constructed to image a large post mortem occipital lobe sample (\textasciitilde 80\texttimes 80\texttimes 80mm3) in a wide-bore 9.4T human scanner with the aim of achieving high-resolution anatomical and quantitative MR images. Compared with a human head coil at 9.4T, the maximum Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) was increased by a factor of about five in the peripheral cortex. Although the transmit profile with a circularly polarized transmit mode at 9.4T is relatively inhomogeneous over the large sample, this challenge was successfully resolved with parallel transmit using the kT-points method. Using this setup, we achieved 60{$\mu$}m anatomical images for the entire occipital lobe showing increased spatial definition of cortical details compared to lower resolutions. In addition, we were able to achieve sufficient control over SNR, B0 and B1 homogeneity and multi-contrast sampling to perform quantitative T2* mapping over the same volume at 200{$\mu$}m. Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling provided maximum posterior estimates of quantitative T2* and their uncertainty, allowing delineation of the stria of Gennari over the entire length and width of the calcarine sulcus. We discuss how custom RF receive coil arrays built to specific large post mortem sample sizes can provide a platform for UHF cortical layer-specific quantitative MRI over large fields of view.}

Therefore the purposes of the study were to develop and evaluate a semi-automated segmentation tool and a modified ellipsoid formula for volumetric analysis of the kidney in non-contrast T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR)-images. Three readers performed semi-automated segmentation of the total kidney volume (TKV) in axial, non-contrast-enhanced T2-weighted MR-images of 24 healthy volunteers (48 kidneys) twice. A semi-automated threshold-based segmentation tool was developed to segment the kidney parenchyma. Furthermore, the three readers measured renal dimensions (length, width, depth) and applied different formulas to calculate the TKV. Manual segmentation served as a reference volume. Volumes of the different methods were compared and time required was recorded. There was no significant difference between the semi-automatically and manually segmented TKV (p = 0.31). The difference in mean volumes was 0.3 ml (95\% confidence interval (CI), -10.1 to 10.7 ml). Semi-automated segmentation was significantly faster than manual segmentation, with a mean difference = 188 s (220 vs. 408 s); p {$<$} 0.05. Volumes did not differ significantly comparing the results of different readers. Calculation of TKV with a modified ellipsoid formula (ellipsoid volume \texttimes{} 0.85) did not differ significantly from the reference volume; however, the mean error was three times higher (difference of mean volumes -0.1 ml; CI -31.1 to 30.9 ml; p = 0.95). Applying the modified ellipsoid formula was the fastest way to get an estimation of the renal volume (41 s). Semi-automated segmentation and volumetric analysis of the kidney in native T2-weighted MR data delivers accurate and reproducible results and was significantly faster than manual segmentation. Applying a modified ellipsoid formula quickly provides an accurate kidney volume.},

  abstract = {Increased signal to noise ratio in ultra high field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has allowed the development of quantitative imaging techniques and new contrast mechanisms, such as Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) to be probed. The development of CEST contrast imaging has involved overcoming a number of technical challenges associated with ultra high field MRI. The B1 transmit field was, and still is, a major challenge. Presented in this thesis, the B1 transmit field in regions of low B1 are improved with the use of dielectric pads and a simulation study shows that the overall B1 transmit field homogeneity is significantly improved when multi-transmit slice-selective RF spokes pulse sequences are used. Multiple methods have been developed to quantify the chemical exchange from slow exchanging proton pools seen in CEST contrast imaging. However, magnetisation transfer (MT) from the macromolecular bound pool contaminates current quantification methods, and presented in this thesis is a method whereby the CEST and MT are simultaneously saturated using dual frequency saturation pulses, allowing the CEST contrast in z-spectra to be separated from the MT and to enhance visualisation of the CEST effects. Despite the considerable interest in CEST, only one study has probed the CEST effects in blood, and interestingly high levels of CEST signals can be observed from the superior sagittal sinus. To investigate these effects, z-spectra from ex vivo blood samples considering the effects of oxygenation, haematocrit levels and cell structure were quantified. Quantification shows that the main source of the CEST signals was from the cells within the blood.},

Receive arrays shaped to the contours of the anatomy increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the image. In this work, the advantages offered by the transmit and receive array techniques are combined for human brain imaging at 9.4 T. Methods A 16-element dual-row transmit array and a 31-element receive array were developed. Based on an accurate numerical model of the transmit array, the deposited power was calculated for different head sizes and positions. The influence of the receive array on the transmit field was characterized. Parallel imaging performance and signal-to-noise ratio of the receive array were evaluated. Results On average, a two fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio was observed in the whole-brain volume when compared with a 16-channel elliptic microstrip transceiver array. The benefits of combining the two arrays, B1+ shimming in three directions and high receive sensitivity, are demonstrated with high-resolution in vivo images. Conclusion The dual-row transmit array provides whole-brain coverage at 9.4 T, which, in combination with the helmet-shaped receive array, is a valuable radio frequency configuration for ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain.

It is characterized by enlargement of the kidneys caused by progressive development of renal cysts, and thus assessment of total kidney volume (TKV) is crucial for studying disease progression in ADPKD. However, automatic segmentation of polycystic kidneys is a challenging task due to severe alteration in the morphology caused by non-uniform cyst formation and presence of adjacent liver cysts.

The purpose of this study was to identify the most efficient kidney volume computation method to be used in clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of treatments on ADPKD progression. Methods and findings We measured single kidney volume (SKV) on two series of MR and CT images from clinical studies on ADPKD (experimental dataset) by two independent operators (expert and beginner), twice, using all of the available methods: polyline manual tracing (reference method), free-hand manual tracing, semi-automatic tracing, Stereology, Mid-slice and Ellipsoid method. Additionally, the expert operator also measured the kidney length. We compared different methods for reproducibility, accuracy, precision, and time required. In addition, we performed a validation study to evaluate the sensitivity of these methods to detect the between-treatment group difference in TKV change over one year, using MR images from a previous clinical study. Reproducibility was higher on CT than MR for all methods, being highest for manual and semiautomatic contouring methods (planimetry). On MR, planimetry showed highest accuracy and precision, while on CT accuracy and precision of both planimetry and Stereology methods were comparable. Mid-slice and Ellipsoid method, as well as kidney length were fast but provided only a rough estimate of kidney volume. The results of the validation study indicated that planimetry and Stereology allow using an importantly lower number of patients to detect changes in kidney volume induced by drug treatment as compared to other methods. Conclusions Planimetry should be preferred over fast and simplified methods for accurately monitoring ADPKD progression and assessing drug treatment effects. Expert operators, especially on MR images, are required for performing reliable estimation of kidney volume. The use of efficient TKV quantification methods considerably reduces the number of patients to enrol in clinical investigations, making them more feasible and significant.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate time-dependent effects of formalin fixation on MRI relaxometry (T1 and T2), diffusion tensor imaging (fractional anisotropy, FA; and mean diffusivity, MD), and myelin water fraction (MWF) measurements throughout intact human brain specimens. Methods: Two whole, neurologically-healthy human brains were immersed in 10\% formalin solution and scanned at 13 time-points between 0 and 1032 hours. Whole brain maps of longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times, FA, MD, and MWF were generated at each time-point to illustrate spatiotemporal changes, and region-of-interest analyses were then performed in eight brain structures to quantify temporal changes with progressive fixation. Results: Although neither of the diffusion measures (FA nor MD) showed significant changes as a function of formalin fixation time, both T1 and T2-relaxation times significantly decreased, and MWF estimates significantly increased with progressive fixation until (and likely beyond) our final measurements were taken at 1032 hours. Conclusions: These results suggest that T1-relaxation, T2-relaxation and MWF estimates must be performed quite early in the fixation process to avoid formalin-induced changes compared to in vivo values; and furthermore, that different ex vivo scans within an experiment must be acquired at consistent (albeit still early) fixation intervals to avoid fixative-related differences between samples. Conversely, ex vivo diffusion measures (FA and MD) appear to depend more on other factors (e.g., pulse sequence optimization, sample temperature, etc.).},

  abstract = {Objectives~Calculation of accurate T1 relaxivity (r1) values for gadolinium-based magnetic resonance contrast agents (GBCAs) is a complex process. As such, often referenced r1 values for the GBCAs at 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T are based on measurements obtained in media that are not clinically relevant, derived from only a small number of concentrations, or available for only a limited number of GBCAs. This study derives the r1 values of the 8 commercially available GBCAs in human whole blood at 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T.         Materials and Methods~Eight GBCAs were serially diluted in human whole blood, at 7 concentrations from 0.0625 to 4 mM. A custom-built phantom held the dilutions in air-tight cylindrical tubes maintained at 37 {$\pm$} 0.5\textdegree C by a heat-circulating system. Images were acquired using inversion recovery sequences with inversion times from 30 milliseconds to 10 seconds at 1.5 T and 3 T as well as 60 milliseconds to 5 seconds at 7 T. A custom MATLAB program was used to automate signal intensity measurements from the images acquired of the phantom. SigmaPlot was used to calculate T1 relaxation times and, finally, r1.         Results~Measured r1 values in units of s-1[BULLET OPERATOR]mM-1 at 1.5 T (3 T/7 T) were 3.9 {$\pm$} 0.2 (3.4 {$\pm$} 0.4/2.8 {$\pm$} 0.4) for Gd-DOTA, 4.6 {$\pm$} 0.2 (4.5 {$\pm$} 0.3/4.2 {$\pm$} 0.3) for Gd-DO3A-butrol, 4.3 {$\pm$} 0.4 (3.8 {$\pm$} 0.2/3.1 {$\pm$} 0.4) for Gd-DTPA, 6.2 {$\pm$} 0.5 (5.4 {$\pm$} 0.3/4.7 {$\pm$} 0.1) for Gd-BOPTA, 4.5 {$\pm$} 0.1 (3.9 {$\pm$} 0.2/3.7 {$\pm$} 0.2) for Gd-DTPA-BMA, 4.4 {$\pm$} 0.2 (4.2 {$\pm$} 0.2/4.3 {$\pm$} 0.2) for Gd-DTPA-BMEA, 7.2 {$\pm$} 0.2 (5.5 {$\pm$} 0.3/4.9 {$\pm$} 0.1) for Gd-EOB-DTPA, and 4.4 {$\pm$} 0.6 (3.5 {$\pm$} 0.6/3.4 {$\pm$} 0.1) for Gd-HP-DO3A.

Conclusions~This report quantifies, for the first time, T1 relaxivity for all 8 gadolinium chelates in common clinical use worldwide, at current relevant field strengths, in human whole blood at physiological temperature (37\textdegree C). The measured r1 values differ to a small degree from previously published values, where such comparisons exist, with the current r1 measurements being that most relevant to clinical practice. The macrocyclic agents, with the exception of Gd-DO3A-butrol, have slightly lower r1 values when compared with the 2 much less stable linear agents, Gd-DTPA-BMA and Gd-DTPA-BMEA. The 2 agents with hepatobiliary excretion, Gd-EOB-DTPA and Gd-BOPTA, have, at 1.5 and 3 T, substantially higher r1 values than all other agents.},

The image super-resolution (SR) is an effective and cost efficient alternative technique to improve the spatial resolution of MR images. Over the past several years, the convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based SR methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, CNNs with very deep network structures usually suffer from the problems of degradation and diminishing feature reuse, which add difficulty to network training and degenerate the transmission capability of details for SR. To address these problems, in this work, a progressive wide residual network with a fixed skip connection (named FSCWRN) based SR algorithm is proposed to reconstruct MR images, which combines the global residual learning and the shallow network based local residual learning. The strategy of progressive wide networks is adopted to replace deeper networks, which can partially relax the above-mentioned problems, while a fixed skip connection helps provide rich local details at high frequencies from a fixed shallow layer network to subsequent networks. The experimental results on one simulated MR image database and three real MR image databases show the effectiveness of the proposed FSCWRN SR algorithm, which achieves improved reconstruction performance compared with other algorithms.},

The image super-resolution (SR) technique offers an alternative approach to improve the spatial resolution of MRI due to its simplicity. Convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based SR algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art performance, in which the global residual learning (GRL) strategy is now commonly used due to its effectiveness for learning image details for SR. However, the partial loss of image details usually happens in a very deep network due to the degradation problem. In this work, we propose a novel residual learning-based SR algorithm for MRI, which combines both multi-scale GRL and shallow network block-based local residual learning (LRL). The proposed LRL module works effectively in capturing high-frequency details by learning local residuals. One simulated MRI dataset and two real MRI datasets have been used to evaluate our algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed SR algorithm achieves superior performance to all of the other compared CNN-based SR algorithms in this work.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Accurate longitudinal relaxation time (T{$_1$}) of arterial blood is important in evaluating blood flow in tissue by arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Few studies have reported the T{$_1$} of human arterial blood in vivo, especially using 3-tesla MR imaging. T{$_1$} values of human venous blood in vivo have been reported, but they differ from those measured in vitro. We aimed to evaluate the accurate T{$_1$} of human arterial blood in vivo. METHODS: We measured T{$_1$} values of blood in 10 healthy volunteers in vivo using an inversion-recovery fast gradient-echo sequence and 3-tesla MR imaging unit. We also measured hematocrit (Hct) values of venous blood samples. After nonselective application of the inversion pulse using a body coil, we obtained MR imaging signals of arterial blood in the abdominal aorta. Similarly, we measured the signals of venous blood in the internal jugular vein. Inversion times varied between 200 and 5000 ms for imaging of the abdominal aorta and 200 and 2500 ms for imaging of the jugular vein. We also acquired signals without the inversion pulse. We estimated T{$_1$} values from the data by nonlinear least squares fitting of a 3-parameter model. RESULTS: The T value (mean{$\pm$}standard deviation) of arterial blood was 1779{$\pm$}80 ms and of venous blood, 1694{$\pm$}77 ms. The average Hct value was 0.47. The R{$_1$} (=1/T{$_1$}) of arterial blood was related to the Hct value as: R{$_1$}=(0.59{$\pm$}0.16)Hct+(0.29{$\pm$}0.07) (mean{$\pm$}standard error) s{$^{-1}$}. For the venous blood, R{$_1$}=(0.70{$\pm$}0.11)Hct+(0.27{$\pm$}0.05) s{$^{-1}$}. CONCLUSION: We observed a T{$_1$} of human arterial blood in vivo of 1779{$\pm$}80 ms at a mean hematocrit value of 0.47 as determined by 3T MR imaging; an even longer T{$_1$} value is expected with a hematocrit value less than 0.47.},

However, since no rapid and accurate method for volumetry has been developed, volumetry has not yet been established in clinical practice, hindering the development of therapies for PKLD. This study presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-based volumetry method for PKLD. Materials and Methods The performance of AI was first evaluated in comparison with ground-truth (GT). We trained a V-net-based convolutional neural network on 175 ADPKD computed tomography (CT) segmentations, which served as the GT and were agreed upon by 3 experts using images from 214 patients analyzed with volumetry. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC), interobserver correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland\textendash Altman plots of 39 GT and AI segmentations in the validation set were compared. Next, the performance of AI on the segmentation of 50 random CT images was compared with that of 11 PKLD specialists based on the resulting DSC and ICC. Results The DSC and ICC of the AI were 0.961 and 0.999729, respectively. The error rate was within 3\% for approximately 95\% of the CT scans (error{$<$}1\%, 46.2\%; 1\%{$\leq$}error{$<$}3\%, 48.7\%). Compared with the specialists, AI showed moderate performance. Furthermore, an outlier in our results confirmed that even PKLD specialists can make mistakes in volumetry. Conclusions PKLD volumetry using AI was fast and accurate. AI performed comparably to human specialists, suggesting its use may be practical in clinical settings.},

Explicit calculations have been carried out for a pure dipole-dipole interaction, showing that for an interacting pair of like spins, or for nuclei in paramagnetic solution, T1 is exactly equal to T2 in the extreme narrow case. For a pair of interacting unlike spins, it is shown that the longitudinal components of the magnetic moments do not have simple exponential decays. This gives rise to a steady and transient Overhauser effect. The transverse components, however, have in all cases, simple exponential decay defined by a single relaxation time T2.

Materials and Methods Diaphragm and kidney motions were measured by using real-time TrueFISP sequences from 10 healthy human volunteers to determine tracking factors at different acceptance windows. Mean tracking factors were used to calculate mean residual errors and improvement factors for the gating-and-following and gating-only algorithms. Results Mean tracking factors for {$\pm$}4, {$\pm$}6, {$\pm$}8 mm and full acceptance windows ranged from 0.6 to 0.7, with large interindividual variations. Acceptance rates increased as the size of the acceptance window increased (acceptance rate for a 4 mm window {$\sim$}50\%). There was a greater reduction of motion errors by gating-and-following (maximum of 1.86 mm) than gating-only (maximum of 7.05 mm). Conclusion Mean tracking factors obtained in this study can be used as a guideline for using the gating-and-following algorithm in navigator-gated kidney scans. The gating-and-following and gating-only algorithms were quantitatively compared, and it was found that the former is more effective in reducing motion errors. J. Magn. Reson.

  abstract = {Background In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), obtaining measured total kidney volume (mTKV) by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and manual tracing is time consuming. Two alternative MR imaging methods have recently been proposed to estimate TKV (eTKVellipsoid and eTKVPANK), which require less time. Study Design Cross-sectional and longitudinal diagnostic test study. Setting \& Participants Patients with ADPKD with a wide range of kidney function and an approved T2-weighted MR image obtained at the University Medical Centers of Groningen, Leiden, Nijmegen, and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in 2007 to 2014. Test set for assessing reproducibility, n=10; cohort for cross-sectional analyses, n=220; and cohort for longitudinal analyses, n=48. Index Tests Average times for eTKVellipsoid and eTKVPANK were 5 and 15 minutes, respectively. Bias is defined as (mTKV~- eTKV)/mTKV~\texttimes{} 100\%; precision, as one standard deviation of bias. Reference Tests mTKV using manual tracing to calculate the area within kidney boundaries times slice thickness. Average time for mTKV was 55 minutes. Results In the test set, intra- and intercoefficients of variation for mTKV, eTKVellipsoid, and eTKVPANK were 1.8\% and 2.3\%, 3.9\% and 6.3\%, and 3.0\% and 3.4\%, respectively. In cross-sectional analysis, baseline mTKV, eTKVellipsoid, and eTKVPANK were 1.96 (IQR, 1.28-2.82), 1.93 (IQR, 1.25-2.82), and 1.81 (IQR, 1.17-2.62) L, respectively. In cross-sectional analysis, bias was 0.02\% {$\pm$} 3.2\%, 1.4\% {$\pm$} 9.2\%, and 4.6\% {$\pm$} 7.6\% for repeat mTKV, eTKVellipsoid, and eTKVPANK, respectively. In longitudinal analysis, no significant differences were observed between percentage change in mTKV (16.7\% {$\pm$} 17.1\%) and percentage change in eTKVellipsoid (19.3\% {$\pm$} 16.1\%) and eTKVPANK (17.8\% {$\pm$} 16.1\%) over 3 years. Limitations Results for follow-up data should be interpreted with caution because of the limited number of patients. Conclusions Both methods for eTKV perform relatively well compared to mTKV and can detect change in TKV over time. Because eTKVellipsoid requires less time than eTKVPANK, we suggest that this method may be preferable in clinical care.},

By incorporating 3D volume navigators (vNavs) into the TRUST pulse sequence, independent measurements of motion during scanning permit evaluation of these errors. Methods The effects of integrated vNavs on TRUST-based T2 estimates were evaluated using simulations and in vivo subject data. Two subjects were scanned with the TRUST+vNav sequence during prescribed movements. Mean motion scores were derived from vNavs and TRUST images, along with a metric of exponential fit quality. Regression analysis was performed between T2 estimates and mean motion scores. Also, motion scores were determined from independent neonatal scans. Results vNavs negligibly affected venous blood T2 estimates and better detected subject motion than fit quality metrics. Regression analysis showed that T2 is biased upward by 4.1 ms per 1\,mm of mean motion score. During neonatal scans, mean motion scores of 0.6 to 2.0\,mm were detected. Conclusion Motion during TRUST causes an overestimate of T2, which suggests a cautious approach when comparing TRUST-based cerebral oxygenation measurements of noncompliant subjects.

  abstract = {During the last five years ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enabled an unprecedented view of living human brain. Brain tissue contrast in most MRI sequences is known to reflect mainly the spatial distributions of myelin and iron. These distributions have been shown to overlap significantly in many brain regions, especially in the cortex. It is of increasing interest to distinguish and identify cortical areas by their appearance in MRI, which has been shown to be feasible in vivo. Parcellation can benefit greatly from quantification of the independent contributions of iron and myelin to MRI contrast. Recent studies using susceptibility mapping claim to allow such a separation of the effects of myelin and iron in MRI. We show, using post-mortem human brain tissue, that this goal can be achieved. After MRI scanning of the block with appropriate T1 mapping and T2* weighted sequences, we section the block and apply a novel technique, proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE), to spatially map iron, phosphorus and sulfur elemental concentrations, simultaneously with 1{$\mu$}m spatial resolution. Because most brain phosphorus is located in myelin phospholipids, a calibration step utilizing element maps of sulfur enables semi-quantitative ex vivo mapping of myelin concentration. Combining results for iron and myelin concentration in a linear model, we have accurately modeled MRI tissue contrasts. Conversely, iron and myelin concentrations can now be estimated from appropriate MRI measurements in post-mortem brain samples.},

This approach effectively doubles the dynamic range of data used for T1 curve fitting. Materials and Methods: We applied this reconstruction algorithm to a 3D-IR TFE sequence used for T1 mapping, validated the technique in a phantom study, and performed T1-map calculations in postosteochondral allograft transplant (OAT) patients. In addition, we performed a signal simulation study to assess the algorithm's capability to reduce the number of inversion times used in the 3D-IR TFE sequence. Results: In comparison to a standard T1-mapping algorithm that uses the magnitude of the MRI signal, the proposed algorithm improves the reliability of T1 relaxation fits to the inversion-recovery three-parameter function. The signal simulation study shows that the number of TI inversion times can be reduced to as few as four, without compromising the accuracy of T1 calculations. Conclusion: This algorithm can be applied to any 2D- or 3D-IR acquisition sequence used in conjunction with dGEMRIC. Application of the algorithm improves the reliability of T1 calculations and allows the number of TIs to be reduced, leading to shorter scan times in dGEMRIC. J. Magn. Reson.

Methods A novel two-dimensional (2D) navigator technique was implemented in concert with flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) preparation and true fast imaging with steady precession (True-FISP) readout. The navigator images were obtained with a low-resolution fast low angle shot readout at end of each arterial spin labeling acquisition. A retrospective algorithm was developed to automatically detect respiratory motion for selective signal averaging. The 2D navigator-gated FAIR True-FISP sequence was performed in ten healthy volunteers and five patients with chronic kidney disease. Results Excellent image quality and comparable cortical perfusion rates (healthy: 276 {$\pm$} 28 mL/100 g/min, patients: 155 {$\pm$} 25 mL/100 g/min) to literature values were obtained. An average of 3-fold signal-to-noise ratio improvement was obtained in the 2D navigator-gated approach compared with the breath-hold acquisition in healthy volunteers. Good image quality was achieved in patients while the results from breath-hold acquisition were unusable. The quantitative perfusion rates were significantly lower in chronic kidney disease patients compared with the healthy volunteers. Conclusion 2D navigator-gated free breathing arterial spin labeling is feasible and is a noninvasive method to evaluate renal perfusion both in healthy subjects and those with chronic kidney disease.

  abstract = {Purpose of review:Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited disorder characterized by the formation of kidney cysts and kidney enlargement, which progresses to kidney failure by the fifth to seventh decade of life in a majority of patients. Disease progression is evaluated primarily through serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements; however, it is known that serum creatinine and eGFR values typically do not change until the fourth or fifth decade of life. Until recently, therapy only existed to target complications of ADPKD. As therapeutic agents continue to be investigated for use in ADPKD, a suitable biomarker of disease progression in place of serum creatinine is needed.Sources of information:This review summarizes recent research regarding the use of total kidney volume as a biomarker in ADPKD, as presented at the Canadian Society of Nephrology symposium held in April 2015.Findings:Measurement of patients? total kidney volume made using ultrasound (US) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown by the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) study to be directly correlated with both increases in cyst volume and change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Additional studies have shown total kidney volume to have an association with complications of ADPKD as well.Limitations:Areas for further study continue to exist in comparison of methods of measuring total kidney volume.Implications:We believe that the evidence suggests that total kidney volume may be an appropriate surrogate marker for ADPKD disease progression.},

We hypothesized that quantitative T2 mapping could better delineate myocardial involvement in these disorders versus T2-weighted imaging.Methods and Results\textemdash Thirty patients with suspected myocarditis or TTCM, referred for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, who met established diagnostic criteria underwent myocardial T2 mapping. T2 values were averaged in involved and remote myocardial segments, both defined by a reviewer blinded to T2 data. In myocarditis, T2 was 65.2{$\pm$}3.2 ms in the involved myocardium versus 53.5{$\pm$}2.1 ms in the remote myocardium (P{$<$}0.001). In TTCM, T2 was 65.6{$\pm$}4.0 ms in the involved myocardium versus 53.6{$\pm$}2.7 ms in the remote segments (P{$<$}0.001). T2 values were similar across remote myocardial segments in patients and all myocardial segments in controls (P{$>$}0.05 for all). T2 maps provided diagnostic data even in patients with difficulty breath holding. A T2 cutoff of 59 ms identified areas of myocardial involvement, with sensitivity and specificity of 94\% and 97\%, respectively. T2 mapping revealed regions of abnormal T2 beyond those identified by wall motion abnormalities or late gadolinium-enhancement positivity. Conventional T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery images were uninterpretable in 7 patients because of artifact and unremarkable in 2 patients who had elevated T2 values. T2-prepared steady-state\textendash free precession images showed areas of signal hyperintensity in only 17 of 30 patients.Conclusions\textemdash Quantitative T2 mapping reliably identifies myocardial involvement in patients with myocarditis and TTCM. T2 mapping delineated a greater extent of myocardial disease in both conditions compared with that identified by wall motion abnormalities, T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery imaging, T2-prepared steady-state\textendash free precession, or late gadolinium enhancement. Quantitative T2 mapping warrants consideration as a robust technique to identify myocardial injury in patients with acute myocarditis or TTCM.},

T1 relaxation times of the renal cortex and medulla were measured in vitro in 14 normal and nine experimental animals. These values were used to compute the amount of tissue contrast between the cortex and medulla and were compared with the degree of corticomedullary differentiation seen in the image. A relationship was noted between increasing T1 values and increasing water content. Corticomedullary contrast decreased with obstruction. The variation in corticomedullary image contrast may be useful for assessing the duration of hydronephrosis.},

This time fits well into the existing gaps in sequences routinely used for neuroimaging, thus giving a motion-corrected sequence with no extra time required. We also demonstrate motion-driven selective reacquisition of k-space to further compensate for subject motion. We perform multiple validation experiments to evaluate accuracy, navigator impact on tissue intensity/contrast, and the improvement in final output. The complete system operates without adding additional hardware to the scanner and requires no external calibration, making it suitable for high-throughput environments.

The nine remaining mice were examined with cross-sectional studies on days 0 (n = 4) and 3 (n = 5). ADCs were measured with a spin-echo echo-planar sequence at five b values ranging from 350 to 1200 sec/mm2.

Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to non-invasively evaluate intra-renal oxygenation levels of the renal medulla in humans. A newly implemented three-dimensional (3-D) multiple gradient-recalled echo sequence, which permits examination of temporal responses to physiological or pharmacological stimuli, was used to monitor changes in intra-renal oxygenation status during water diuresis. Five healthy, young subjects (22{$\pm$}1.2 years) took part in the study. BOLD MRI data were acquired before and after water loading. Studies were repeated on a separate day after the subjects were pretreated with naproxen. Water diuresis significantly improved renal medullary oxygenation levels in all subjects (pre-waterload=30.3 1/s vs post-waterload 22.8 1/s); however, the temporal response was found to be subject dependent. In the presence of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition by naproxen, the improvement in oxygenation during water diuresis was completely abolished (pre-waterload=27.5 1/s vs post-waterload 28.5 1/s). Monitoring of temporal responses for the first time during water loading allowed for an appreciation of subject dependence. Comparison of the temporal response in terms of slopes demonstrated a significant difference between the waterload studies with and without naproxen (with naproxen=0.056 1/(s min) vs without naproxen=0.25 1/(s min)). The observed effects of naproxen were consistent with previous findings with COX inhibition.},

Samples are routinely fixed and stained to allow for longer scan times with increased contrast and resolution. Although the zebrafish is an important model for neuroscience, to date most MRH studies have focused almost exclusively on mice. In this paper, we examined, for the first time, the zebrafish brain using MRH. We compared a range of fixatives, contrast agents, and fixation/staining durations to determine optimal imaging of the zebrafish brain. By quantifying the T1, T2, and T2* relaxation values, we demonstrated that ethanol and potassium permanganate are unviable for imaging and significant differences exist between mono and di-aldehydes. Furthermore, we compared two commercially available gadolinium-based contrast agents, Magnevist\textregistered{} and Optimark\textregistered, at five different concentrations. For both contrast agents, a concentration of 0.5\% was determined to be ideal as it significantly shortened the T1 but maintained a relatively long T2 and T2*. Subsequently, we analyzed the duration of fixation/staining and established a period of 12 h, which best minimized T1 values but maintained T2 and T2* values. Finally, using this optimized fixation and staining protocol, we performed a gradient-echo T2*-weighted imaging to obtain an image set of the adult zebrafish brain at an isotropic resolution of 10 \textmu m.

Pixel brightness in the 0-to-255 range was rescaled to zero for black and 200 for fascia brightness before automatic classification into 14 ranges, including ``blood-like'' (0\textendash 4), ``fat-like'' (8\textendash 26), ``hypoechoic muscle-like'' (41\textendash 60), ``hyperechoic muscle-like'' (61\textendash 76), 4 ranges of ``fiber-like'' (112\textendash 196), ``calcium-like'' (211\textendash 255) and intermediary intervals. Nomenclature was readapted using nonechoic, hypoechoic I to IV, echoic I to IV, hyperechoic I to IV, and saturated echoes to avoid inference to actual kidney tissue. Descriptive and comparative statistics were based on percentages of pixels in specific brightness ranges.         Sample Population~Eight women and 2 men, 26 {$\pm$} 4 years (range, 22\textendash 34 years) old, were studied. Kidney length was 10.5 {$\pm$} 0.9 cm (9.0\textendash 12.0 cm). Doppler US resistivity index was 0.67 {$\pm$} 0.03 (0.62\textendash 0.71).         Results~Original fascia brightness converted to 200 value had a mean {$\pm$} SD of 206 {$\pm$} 16 (range, 181\textendash 236). Kidney grayscale median averaged 37 {$\pm$} 6 (27\textendash 48). Most pixels were hypoechoic II to IV (8\textendash 60), averaging 78\% {$\pm$} 6\% (66\%\textendash 87\%). Percentages for fat-like, intermediary fat/muscle-like, and hypoechoic muscle-like intervals averaged 25\%, 28\%, and 25\%, respectively.         Conclusions~A reference database for USTC/USVH of normal young kidneys was created for future comparisons with transplanted and abnormal kidneys. Normal renal echoes have low brightness. Hyperechoic pixels may represent abnormalities.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of quantifying functional renal volume with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all subjects gave informed consent. A contour-detection three-dimensional algorithm for determining renal volumes was developed. The method was validated in 18 cadaveric pig kidneys by measuring the water displacement caused by the kidneys. The kidney lengths and volumes in 19 consecutive potential kidney donors who underwent gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography of the renal arteries also were determined. Differences in volume measurements between men and women and between left and right kidneys were analyzed by using the Student t test. The volume of perfused renal cortex was calculated by extracting voxels on the basis of the cortex signal intensity threshold. The relevance of renal function parameters\textemdash namely, creatinine clearance rates\textemdash in the donor candidates was assessed by using a linear regression model. Intra- and interobserver variabilities of the measurements were determined by using the Bland-Altman method.RESULTS: Volume measurements of the cadaveric pig kidneys obtained by using MR angiography and the water displacement method were strongly correlated (r = 0.99). The mean total renal volume in the donor candidates was 196 mL (range, 136\textendash 295 mL). No significant differences in total renal volume between the men and women or between the left and right kidneys were found. The correlation between calculated renal cortex volumes (mean, 67 mL; range, 40\textendash 105 mL) and creatinine clearance rates was good (r = 0.69). Inter- and intraobserver variabilities were lower than 7\%.CONCLUSION: Quantification of functional renal volume with three-dimensional gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography seems feasible with use of the described semiautomatic method.\textcopyright{} RSNA, 2005},

Laborious and time-consuming manual tracing of kidneys and liver is the current gold standard. We developed a fully automated segmentation method for TKV and TLV measurement that uses a deep learning network optimized to perform semantic segmentation of kidneys and liver. Methods We used 80\% of a set of 440 abdominal magnetic resonance images (T2-weighted HASTE coronal sequences) from patients with ADPKD to train the network and the remaining 20\% for validation. Both kidneys and liver were also segmented manually. To evaluate the method's performance, we used an additional test set of images from 100 patients, 45 of whom were also involved in longitudinal analyses. Results TKV and TLV measured by the automated approach correlated highly with manually traced TKV and TLV (intraclass correlation coefficients, 0.998 and 0.996, respectively), with low bias and high precision ({$<$}0.1\%{$\pm$}2.7\% for TKV and -1.6\%{$\pm$}3.1\% for TLV); this was comparable with inter-reader variability of manual tracing ({$<$}0.1\%{$\pm$}3.5\% for TKV and -1.5\%{$\pm$}4.8\% for TLV). For longitudinal analysis, bias and precision were {$<$}0.1\%{$\pm$}3.2\% for TKV and 1.4\%{$\pm$}2.9\% for TLV growth. Conclusions These findings demonstrate a fully automated segmentation method that measures TKV, TLV, and changes in these parameters as accurately as manual tracing. This technique may facilitate future studies in which automated and reproducible TKV and TLV measurements are needed to assess disease severity, disease progression, and treatment response.},

It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

Regional T1 and T2 values were compared among groups and also with histopathologic estimates of iron concentration.RESULTS: In healthy subjects, interregional T1 and T2 differences in the cortex and basal ganglia showed a good correlation with reported values for iron concentration, and intraregional variations were generally consistent with reported variability of iron concentration. Patients with multiple system atrophy had T1 and T2 shortening in the globus pallidus consistent with reported increases in ferritin-bound iron and changes in the putamen consistent with accumulation of hemosiderin (posterior portion) and neuromelanin (remainder). Both groups of patients had changes in the cortex that are consistent with decreased ferritin concentration and T2 changes in white matter consistent with demyelination. Patients with Parkinson disease also had a (nonsignificant) T2 shortening in the substantia nigra that was suggestive of iron accumulation.CONCLUSION: Most of the T1 and T2 findings appear to be related to changes in iron content and form and may possibly be used as indicators of such changes.},

DeepNAT is an end-to-end learning-based approach to brain segmentation that jointly learns an abstract feature representation and a multi-class classification. We propose a 3D patch-based approach, where we do not only predict the center voxel of the patch but also neighbors, which is formulated as multi-task learning. To address a class imbalance problem, we arrange two networks hierarchically, where the first one separates foreground from background, and the second one identifies 25 brain structures on the foreground. Since patches lack spatial context, we augment them with coordinates. To this end, we introduce a novel intrinsic parameterization of the brain volume, formed by eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As network architecture, we use three convolutional layers with pooling, batch normalization, and non-linearities, followed by fully connected layers with dropout. The final segmentation is inferred from the probabilistic output of the network with a 3D fully connected conditional random field, which ensures label agreement between close voxels. The roughly 2.7million parameters in the network are learned with stochastic gradient descent. Our results show that DeepNAT compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the purely learning-based method may have a high potential for the adaptation to young, old, or diseased brains by fine-tuning the pre-trained network with a small training sample on the target application, where the availability of larger datasets with manual annotations may boost the overall segmentation accuracy in the future.},

  abstract = {Improvements in the spatial resolution of structural and functional MRI are beginning to enable analysis of intracortical structures such as heavily myelinated layers in 3D, a prerequisite for in-vivo parcellation of individual human brains. This parcellation can only be performed precisely if the profiles used in cortical analysis are anatomically meaningful. Profiles are often constructed as traverses that are perpendicular to computed laminae. In this case they are fully determined by these laminae. The aim of this study is to evaluate models for cortical laminae used so far and to establish a new model. Methods to model the laminae used so far include constructing laminae that keep a constant distance to the cortical boundaries, so-called equidistant laminae. Another way is to compute equipotentials between the cortical boundary surfaces with the Laplace equation. The Laplace profiles resulting from the gradients to the equipotentials were often-used because of their nice mathematical properties. However, the equipotentials these Laplacian profiles are constructed from and the equidistant laminae do not follow the anatomical layers observed using high resolution MRI of cadaver brain. To remedy this problem, we introduce a novel equi-volume model that derives from work by Bok (1929). He argued that cortical segments preserve their volume, while layer thickness changes to compensate cortical folding. We incorporate this preservation of volume in our new equi-volume model to generate a three-dimensional well-adapted undistorted coordinate system of the cortex. When defined by this well-adapted coordinate system, cortical depth is anatomically meaningful. We compare isocontours from these cortical depth values to locations of myelinated bands on high-resolution ex-vivo and in-vivo three-dimensional MR images. A similar comparison was performed with equipotentials computed with the Laplace equation and with equidistant isocontours. A quantitative evaluation of the equi-volume model using measured image intensities confirms that it provides a much better fit to observed cortical layering.},

A questionnaire regarding surgical approach and planning was administered. The presumed pre-operative approaches with and without the model were compared. Any change between the presumed approaches and the actual surgical intervention was recorded.ResultsThere was a change in planned approach with the 3D printed model for all ten cases with the largest impact seen regarding decisions on transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach and clamping, with changes seen in 30\%\textendash 50\% of cases. Mean parenchymal volume loss for the operated kidney was 21.4\%. Volume losses {$>$}20\% were associated with increased ischemia times and surgeons tended to report a different approach with the use of the 3D model compared to that with imaging alone in these cases.

  abstract = {The maximum tetanic tension of skeletal muscle (P0) is often estimated based on calculation of physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). PCSA depends on muscle volume, pennation angle, and fiber length. Studies documenting PCSA in fixed human muscles usually compute muscle volume by dividing muscle mass by density. These studies use a density value of 1.0597g/cm3, which was originally based on unfixed rabbit and canine muscle tissue. Due to the dehydration effects of different fixation methods, the variable hydration that occurs when fixed tissue is stored in buffered saline, and the potential for species-specific muscle density, this value may be incorrect and an accurate value for fixed human muscle density is needed. To obtain an accurate density and water content values, 4\% formaldehyde-fixed (n=54) and 37\% formaldehyde-fixed (n=54) cadaveric human muscle samples were divided into 6 groups (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, or 30h) for hydration in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Measurements of volume, water content, and mass were made enabling calculation of muscle density. Additionally, water content was measured in living muscle (n=4) to determine the appropriate hydration time in PBS.

  abstract = {Purpose Abnormalities in hepatic oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption may serve as a significant indicator of hepatic cellular dysfunction and may predict treatment response. However, conventional and oxygen-enhanced hepatic BOLD MRI can only provide semiquantitative assessment of hepatic oxygenation. Methods A hepatic quantitative BOLD (qBOLD) model was proposed for noninvasive mapping of hepatic venous blood oxygen saturation (Yv) and deoxygenated blood volume (DBV) in human subjects. The validity and the estimation bias of the proposed model were evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. Eight healthy subjects were scanned after written consent with institutional review board approval. Results Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the proposed single-compartment hepatic qBOLD model leads to significant deviation of the predicted T2* decay profile from the simulated signal due to high hepatic blood volume fraction. Small relative estimation bias for hepatic Yv and significant overestimation for hepatic DBV were observed, which can be corrected by applying the calibration curves established from simulations. After correction, the mean hepatic Yv in human subjects was 56.8 {$\pm$} 6.8\%, and the mean hepatic DBV was 0.190 {$\pm$} 0.035, consistent with measurements from other invasive approaches. Except in regions with significant vascular contamination, the maps for hepatic Yv and DBV were relatively homogenous. Conclusions With estimation bias correction, the hepatic qBOLD approach enables noninvasive mapping of hepatic blood volume and oxygenation in human subjects. The established protocol may be used to quantitatively assess hepatic tissue hypoxia in multiple liver diseases.},

To this end, a sequence is presented for determining the T2 of vascular blood in regions in which motions of the body and of the blood itself present a major challenge. With use of this sequence on a commercial 1.5-T whole-body imager, the relationship between the T2 and \%HbO2 of blood is calibrated in vitro for the conditions expected in vivo. T2 varies predictably from about 30 to 250 msec as \%HbO2 varies from 30\% to 96\%. T2 values measured in situ for vascular blood in the mediastinum of several healthy subjects qualitatively reflected the behavior observed in vitro. Estimates of \%HbO2 for these vessels obtained with the in vitro calibration appear reasonable, particularly for venous blood, although difficulties arise in selecting the appropriate calibration factors. These encouraging initial results support a more systematic study of potential sources of error and an examination of the accuracy of in vivo measurements by comparison with direct measurements of \%HbO2 in vessels.},

Quantitative MRI can assess local tubular function and is able to determine the concentrating mechanism of the kidney noninvasively in real time. Measuring single nephron function is now a near possibility. In parallel to advancing imaging techniques for kidney microstructure is a need to carefully understand the relationship between the local source of MRI contrast and the underlying physiological change. The development of these imaging markers can impact the accurate diagnosis and treatment of kidney disease.

  abstract = {Disruption of the regulatory role of the kidneys leads to diverse renal pathologies; one major hallmark is inflammation and fibrosis. Conventional magnitude MRI has been used to study renal pathologies; however, the quantification or even detection of focal lesions caused by inflammation and fibrosis is challenging. We propose that quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) may be particularly sensitive for the identification of inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, we applied QSM in a mouse model deficient for angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1). This model is known for graded pathologies, including focal interstitial fibrosis, cortical inflammation, glomerulocysts and inner medullary hypoplasia. We acquired high-resolution MRI on kidneys from AT1-deficient mice that were perfusion fixed with contrast agent. Two MR sequences were used (three-dimensional spin echo and gradient echo) to produce three image contrasts: T1, T2* (magnitude) and QSM. T1 and T2* (magnitude) images were acquired to segment major renal structures and to provide landmarks for the focal lesions of inflammation and fibrosis in the three-dimensional space. The volumes of major renal structures were measured to determine the relationship of the volumes to the degree of renal abnormalities and magnetic susceptibility values. Focal lesions were segmented from QSM images and were found to be closely associated with the major vessels. Susceptibilities were relatively more paramagnetic in wild-type mice: 1.46 {$\pm$} 0.36 in the cortex, 2.14 {$\pm$} 0.94 in the outer medulla and 2.10 {$\pm$} 2.80 in the inner medulla (10\textendash 2 ppm). Susceptibilities were more diamagnetic in knockout mice: \textendash 7.68 {$\pm$} 4.22 in the cortex, \textendash 11.46 {$\pm$} 2.13 in the outer medulla and \textendash 7.57 {$\pm$} 5.58 in the inner medulla (10\textendash 2 ppm). This result was consistent with the increase in diamagnetic content, e.g. proteins and lipids, associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Focal lesions were validated with conventional histology. QSM was very sensitive in detecting pathology caused by small focal inflammation and fibrosis. QSM offers a new MR contrast mechanism to study this common disease marker in the kidney.

Methods Normal mouse kidneys (n\,=\,4) were imaged at 9.4T using a three-dimensional gradient multi-echo sequence (55-micron isotropic resolution). Phase images from 12 orientations were obtained to compute the susceptibility tensor. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with 12 encoding directions was compared with STI. Tractography was performed to visualize and track the course of tubules with DTI and STI. Confocal microscopy was used to identify which tubular segments of the nephron were detected by DTI and STI. Results Diffusion anisotropy was limited to the inner medulla of the kidney. DTI did not find a significant number of coherent tubular tracks in the outer medulla or cortex. With STI, we found strong susceptibility anisotropy and many tracks in the inner and outer medulla and in limited areas of the cortex. Conclusion STI was able to track tubules throughout the kidney, whereas DTI was limited to the inner medulla. STI provides a novel contrast mechanism related to local tubule microstructure and may offer a powerful method to study the nephron.

  abstract = {A T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) technique was recently developed to estimate cerebral blood oxygenation, providing potentials for non-invasive assessment of the brain's oxygen consumption. A limitation of the current sequence is the need for long TR, as shorter TR causes an over-estimation in blood R2. The present study proposes a post-saturation TRUST by placing a non-selective 90\textdegree{} pulse after the signal acquisition to reset magnetization in the whole brain. This scheme was found to eliminate estimation bias at a slight cost of precision. To improve the precision, TE of the sequence was optimized and it was found that a modest TE shortening of 3.4ms can reduce the estimation error by 49\%. We recommend the use of post-saturation TRUST sequence with a TR of 3000ms and a TE of 3.6ms, which allows the determination of global venous oxygenation with scan duration of 1 minute 12 seconds and an estimation precision of {$\pm$}1\% (in units of oxygen saturation percentage).},

  abstract = {A method is presented for three-dimensional reconstruction of the mouse brain from histological sections with the guidance of magnetic resonance images (MRI). A major focus of the method is dealing with sections in which anatomical structures have been separated or distorted as a result of histological processing. Although histology has superb resolution with the ability to discriminate cell types and anatomical structures, misalignment between sections and distortion within sections renders 3D reconstruction of the histology volume simply by stacking 2D sections inadequate. In contrast, MRI preserves the spatial and geometric information about structures at a cost of cellular detail. To utilize the information from MRI in reconstructing volumetric histological data, we developed a procedure consisting of a series of segmentation and registration operations. The method is iterative and first identifies the corresponding MRI slices for each histological section. Piecewise rigid registration is then employed to deal with tissue distortion caused by histological processing. Quantitative validation of the method's accuracy was performed on four reconstructed mouse brains by comparing a set of manually selected anatomical landmarks on pairs of MRI and histological volumes. The procedure is highly automated and amenable to high throughput.},

  abstract = {Aim To assess the performance of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of renal fibrosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD), with histopathology as a reference standard. Materials and methods Forty patients with CKD and 30 healthy volunteers were recruited for the study. All participants underwent diffusion-weighted MRI. Renal biopsy was performed in 25 patients with CKD. Mean renal medullary and cortical apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were compared between CKD patients and the healthy volunteers. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to investigate the relationship between ADC values, serum creatinine (SCr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 24~h urinary protein (24h-UPRO), and renal histopathological scores. Results Cortical and medullary ADC values in the CKD group were significantly lower compared to those in the healthy controls. In the CKD group, a significant negative correlation was found between cortical ADC values and SCr/24h-UPRO, and significant positive correlation was found between cortical ADC and eGFR. There was also a significant negative correlation between medullary ADC values and SCr. Both cortical and medullary ADC values were significantly correlated with histopathological fibrosis score. Conclusion Renal ADC values strongly correlate with histological measures of fibrosis, and have the potential to enhance the non-invasive monitoring of chronic kidney disease.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the transverse relaxation rates R2 and R of blood is relevant for quantitative assessment of functional MRI (fMRI) results, including calibration of blood oxygenation and measurement of tissue oxygen extraction fractions (OEFs). In a temperature controlled circulation system, these rates were measured for blood in vitro at 3T under conditions akin to the physiological state. Single spin echo (SE) and gradient echo (GRE) sequences were used to determine R2 and R, respectively. Both rates varied quadratically with deoxygenation, and changes in R were found to be due predominantly to changes in R2. These data were used to estimate intravascular blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contributions during visual activation. Due to the large R in venous blood, intravascular SE BOLD signal changes were larger than GRE effects at echo times above 30 ms. When including extravascular effects to estimate the total BOLD effect, GRE BOLD dominated due to the large tissue volume fraction.

  abstract = {Background and objective Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assist in both functional and structural analysis of the heart, but due to hardware and physical limitations, high-resolution MRI scans is time consuming and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is low. The existing super-resolution methods attempt to resolve this issue, but there are still shortcomings, such as hallucinate details after super-resolution, low precision after reconstruction, etc. To dispose these problems, we propose the Laplacian Pyramid Generation Adversarial Network (LSRGAN) in order to generate visually better cardiovascular ultrasound images so as to aid physician diagnosis and treatment. Methods and results In order to address the problem of low image resolution, we used the Laplacian Pyramid to analyze the high-frequency detail features of super-resolution (SR) reconstruction of images with different pixel sizes. To eliminate gradient disappearance, we implemented the least squares loss function as the discriminator, we introduce the residual-dense block (RDB) as the basic network building unit is used to generate higher quality images. The experimental results show that the LSRGAN can effectively avoid the illusion details after super-resolution and has the best reconstruction quality. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed algorithm generates higher quality super-resolution images that comes with higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity (SSIM) scores. Conclusion We implemented a novel LSRGAN network model, which solves reduces insufficient resolution and hallucinate details of MRI after super-resolution. Our research presents a superior super-resolution method for medical experts to diagnose and treat myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction.},

  abstract = {Renal function varies according to the nature and stage of diseases. Renal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a technique considered superior to the most common method used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate, allows for noninvasive, accurate measurements of renal structures and functions in both animals and humans. It has become increasingly prevalent in research and clinical applications. In recent years, renal fMRI has developed rapidly with progress in MRI hardware and emerging postprocessing algorithms. Function-related imaging markers can be acquired via renal fMRI, encompassing water molecular diffusion, perfusion, and oxygenation. This review focuses on the progression and challenges of the main renal fMRI methods, including dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, blood oxygen level-dependent MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, arterial spin labeling, fat fraction imaging, and their recent clinical applications.
