  abstract = {TensorFlow [1] is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be
executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds
of machines and thousands of computational devices such as
GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been
used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural
language processing, geographic information extraction, and
computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference
implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.},

The present study was primarily designed to assess the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in a Mexican urban population residing in Mexico and to evaluate certain biologic and socioeconomic conditions as risk factors for the development of renal disease. A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted, which included 3564 patients of either gender aged {$>$}18 years, who were randomly selected from lists of patients assigned to primary care facilities in the city of Morelia. A questionnaire about personal current health status, kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease in close relatives, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, and blood and urine samples to measure glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine was obtained for each patient. Creatinine clearance (Ccr) was calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Patients were classified in 1 of the 5 Ccr categories established by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. The prevalence rate of Ccr {$<$} 15mL/min was 1142 per million population, and that of Ccr {$<$}60mL/min 80,788 per million population.

Materials and Methods: This animal study was IACUC approved. Seventeen male, C57BL/6 mice were divided into control (n = 2) and experimental groups (n = 15), the latter fed a 3, 5-dicarbethoxy-1, 4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) supplemented diet, inducing hepatic fibrosis. Ex vivo liver specimens were imaged using an 11.7T MRI scanner. Spin-echo pulsed field gradient and multi-echo spin-echo acquisitions were used to generate parametric ADC and T2 maps, respectively. Degrees of fibrosis were determined by the evaluation of a pathologist as well as digital image analysis. Scatterplot graphs comparing ADC and T2 to degrees of fibrosis were generated and correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: Strong correlation was found between degrees of hepatic fibrosis and ADC with higher degrees of fibrosis associated with lower hepatic ADC values. Moderate correlation between hepatic fibrosis and T2 values was seen with higher degrees of fibrosis associated with lower T2 values. Conclusion: Inverse relationships between degrees of fibrosis and both ADC and T2 are seen, highlighting the utility of these parameters in the ongoing development of an MRI methodology to quantify hepatic fibrosis.

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging is often performed by acquiring a series of diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar images with different direction diffusion gradients. A problem of echo-planar images is the geometrical distortions that obtain near junctions between tissues of differing magnetic susceptibility. This results in distorted diffusion-tensor maps. To resolve this we suggest acquiring two images for each diffusion gradient; one with bottom-up and one with top-down traversal of k-space in the phase-encode direction. This achieves the simultaneous goals of providing information on the underlying displacement field and intensity maps with adequate spatial sampling density even in distorted areas. The resulting DT maps exhibit considerably higher geometric fidelity, as assessed by comparison to an image volume acquired using a conventional 3D MR technique.},

In addition a susceptibility-induced field can be supplied and will be incorporated into the calculations in a way that accurately reflects that the two fields (susceptibility- and EC-induced) behave differently in the presence of subject movement. The method is based on registering the individual volumes to a model free prediction of what each volume should look like, thereby enabling its use on high b-value data where the contrast is vastly different in different volumes. In addition we show that the linear EC-model commonly used is insufficient for the data used in the present paper (high spatial and angular resolution data acquired with Stejskal\textendash{}Tanner gradients on a 3T Siemens Verio, a 3T Siemens Connectome Skyra or a 7T Siemens Magnetome scanner) and that a higher order model performs significantly better.

  abstract = {Techniques to measure morphological parameters, such as glomerular (and thereby nephron) number, glomerular size, and kidney volume, have been vital to understanding factors contributing to chronic kidney disease (CKD). These techniques have also been important to understanding the associations between CKD and other systemic and cardiovascular diseases and have led to the identification of developmental risk factors for these pathologies. However, existing techniques in quantitative kidney morphology are resource- and time-consuming and are destructive to the organ. This review discusses the emerging generation of techniques to study kidney morphology quantitatively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the intravenous injection of the superparamagnetic nanoparticle cationic ferritin, which binds to the glomerular basement membrane. A primary advantage of MRI over previously established techniques is the ability to quantify morphology in the intact organ with minimal sample preparation. We highlight areas of research where MRI-based morphological measurements will be helpful in animal models and possibly diagnostic clinical nephrology, discuss technical challenges in light of the progress in MRI techniques to date, and identify novel measurements that may be possible using MRI, both ex vivo and in vivo.},

  abstract = {The ability to noninvasively assess skeletal muscle microstructure, which predicts function and disease, would be of significant clinical value. One method that holds this promise is diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI), which is sensitive to the microscopic diffusion of water within tissues and has become ubiquitous in neuroimaging as a way of assessing neuronal structure and damage. However, its application to the assessment of changes in muscle microstructure associated with injury, pathology, or age remains poorly defined, because it is difficult to precisely control muscle microstructural features in vivo. However, recent advances in additive manufacturing technologies allow precision-engineered diffusion phantoms with histology informed skeletal muscle geometry to be manufactured. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop skeletal muscle phantoms at relevant size scales to relate microstructural features to MRI-based diffusion measurements. A digital light projection based rapid 3D printing method was used to fabricate polyethylene glycol diacrylate based diffusion phantoms with (1) idealized muscle geometry (no geometry; fiber sizes of 30, 50, or 70\,{$\mu$}m or fiber size of 50\,{$\mu$}m with 40\% of walls randomly deleted) or (2) histology-based geometry (normal and after 30-days of denervation) containing 20\% or 50\% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Mean absolute percent error (8\%) of the printed phantoms indicated high conformity to templates when ``fibers'' were {$>$}50\,{$\mu$}m. A multiple spin-echo echo planar imaging diffusion sequence, capable of acquiring diffusion weighted data at several echo times, was used in an attempt to combine relaxometry and diffusion techniques with the goal of separating intracellular and extracellular diffusion signals. When fiber size increased (30\textendash{}70\,{$\mu$}m) in the 20\% PBS phantom, fractional anisotropy (FA) decreased (0.32\textendash{}0.26) and mean diffusivity (MD) increased (0.44\,\texttimes\,10-3 mm2/s\textendash{}0.70\,\texttimes\,10-3 mm2/s). Similarly, when fiber size increased from 30 to 70\,{$\mu$}m in the 50\% PBS diffusion phantoms, a small change in FA was observed (0.18\textendash{}0.22), but MD increased from 0.86\,\texttimes\,10-3 mm2/s to 1.79\,\texttimes\,10-3 mm2/s. This study demonstrates a novel application of tissue engineering to understand complex diffusion signals in skeletal muscle. Through this work, we have also demonstrated the feasibility of 3D printing for skeletal muscle with relevant matrix geometries and physiologically relevant tissue characteristics.},

However, the influence of chemical processes caused by formalin fixation and differences in temperature may hamper the comparability with results from in vivo MRI. In this study we investigated how formalin fixation and temperature affect T1, T2 and T2* relaxation times of brain tissue. Fixation effects were examined with respect to changes in water content and crosslinking. Relaxometry was performed in brain slices from five deceased subjects at different temperatures. All measurements were repeated after 190 days of formaldehyde immersion. The water content of unfixed and fixed tissue was determined using the wet-to-dry ratio following drying. Protein weight was determined with sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Fixation caused a strong decrease of all relaxation times, the strongest effect being seen on T1, with a reduction of up to 76\%. The temperature coefficient of T1 was lower in the fixed than unfixed tissue, which was in contrast to T2, where an increase of the temperature coefficient was observed following fixation. The reduction of the water content after fixation was in the range of 1\textendash{}6\% and thus not sufficient to explain the changes in relaxation time. Results from SDS-PAGE indicated a strong increase of the protein size above 260 kDa in all brain structures examined. Our results suggest that crosslinking induced changes of the macromolecular matrix are responsible for T1 shortening and a decreased temperature dependency. The relaxation times provided in this work should allow optimization of post-mortem MRI protocols for the brain. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

It involves consideration of the fiber-to-field angle for linear structures such as tendons, ligaments, and peripheral nerves, disc-like and circular structures such as menisci and labra, as well as complex three-dimensional structures. There may be one or more fiber types with different orientations within each of these tissues. The orientation of these fibers to B0 is crucial in determining their magic angle effect. Tissues may show a variety of appearances depending on their baseline T2, as well as the increase in T2 produced by the magic angle effect. The appearances are affected by TE, which affects both the general tissue signal level and the change in signal produced by the magic angle effect, fiber-to-slice orientation, and partial volume effects. Deliberate positioning of structures and tissues at particular orientations to B0 can be used to increase the signal from tissues such as tendons and ligaments and so allow them to be imaged with conventional sequences. The technique can also be used to produce contrast between tissues with fibers that have different orientations to B0. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2007. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

A comprehensive analysis of the hemodynamics in the thoracic aorta is presented based on the integration of flow-sensitive 4D MRI with state-of-the-art rapid prototyping technology and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Rapid prototyping was used to transform aortic geometries as measured by contrast-enhanced MR angiography into realistic vascular models with large anatomical coverage. Integration into a flow circuit with patient-specific pulsatile in-flow conditions and application of flow-sensitive 4D MRI permitted detailed analysis of local and global 3D flow dynamics in a realistic vascular geometry. Visualization of characteristic 3D flow patterns and quantitative comparisons of the in vitro experiments with in vivo data and CFD simulations in identical vascular geometries were performed to evaluate the accuracy of vascular model systems. The results indicate the potential of such patient-specific model systems for detailed experimental simulation of realistic vascular hemodynamics. Further studies are warranted to examine the influence of refined boundary conditions of the human circulatory system such as fluid-wall interaction and their effect on normal and pathological blood flow characteristics associated with vascular geometry.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. The incidence of ESRD is increasing dramatically. Progression to end-stage may be halted or slowed when kidney damage is detected at an early stage. Kidney damage is frequently asymptomatic but is indicated by the presence of proteinuria, hematuria, or reduced GFR. Population-based studies relating to the prevalence of kidney damage in the community are limited, particularly outside of the United States. Therefore, the prevalence of proteinuria, hematuria, and reduced GFR in the Australian adult population was determined using a cross-sectional study of 11,247 noninstitutionalized Australians aged 25 yr or over, randomly selected using a stratified, cluster method. Subjects were interviewed and tested for proteinuria\textemdash{}spot urine protein to creatinine ratio (abnormal: {$\geq$}0.20 mg/mg); hematuria\textemdash{}spot urine dipstick (abnormal: 1+ or greater) confirmed by urine microscopy (abnormal: {$>$}10,000 red blood cells per milliliter) or dipstick (abnormal: 1+ or greater) on midstream urine sample; and reduced GFR\textemdash{}Cockcroft-Gault estimated GFR (abnormal: {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m2). The associations between age, gender, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, and indicators of kidney damage were examined. Proteinuria was detected in 2.4\% of cases (95\% CI: 1.6\%, 3.1\%), hematuria in 4.6\% (95\% CI: 3.8\%, 5.4\%), and reduced GFR in 11.2\% (95\% CI: 8.6\%, 13.8\%). Approximately 16\% had at least one indicator of kidney damage. Age, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were independently associated with proteinuria; age, gender, and hypertension with hematuria; and age, gender, and hypertension with reduced GFR. Approximately 16\% of the Australian adult population has either proteinuria, hematuria, and/or reduced GFR, indicating the presence of kidney damage. Identifying and targeting this section of the population may provide a means to reduce the burden of ESRD. E-mail: bob.atkins@med.monash. edu.au},

  abstract = {Fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to image the kidneys without any contrast media. FA of the medulla has been shown to correlate with kidney function. It is expected that higher spatial resolution would improve the depiction of small structures within the kidney. However, the achievement of high spatial resolution in renal DTI remains challenging as a result of respiratory motion and susceptibility to diffusion imaging artefacts. In this study, a targeted field of view (TFOV) method was used to obtain high-resolution FA maps and colour-coded diffusion tensor orientations, together with measures of the medullary and cortical FA, in 12 healthy subjects. Subjects were scanned with two implementations (dual and single kidney) of a TFOV DTI method. DTI scans were performed during free breathing with a navigator-triggered sequence. Results showed high consistency in the greyscale FA, colour-coded FA and diffusion tensors across subjects and between dual- and single-kidney scans, which have in-plane voxel sizes of 2\,\texttimes\,2\,mm2 and 1.2\,\texttimes\,1.2\,mm2, respectively. The ability to acquire multiple contiguous slices allowed the medulla and cortical FA to be quantified over the entire kidney volume. The mean medulla and cortical FA values were 0.38\,{$\pm$}\,0.017 and 0.21\,{$\pm$}\,0.019, respectively, for the dual-kidney scan, and 0.35\,{$\pm$}\,0.032 and 0.20\,{$\pm$}\,0.014, respectively, for the single-kidney scan. The mean FA between the medulla and cortex was significantly different (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) for both dual- and single-kidney implementations. High-spatial-resolution DTI shows promise for improving the characterization and non-invasive assessment of kidney function. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.

  abstract = {Background and objectives Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by increased total kidney volume (TKV) and renal failure. This study aimed to determine if height-adjusted TKV (htTKV) predicts the onset of renal insufficiency.
Design, setting, participants, \& measurements This prospective, observational, longitudinal, multicenter study included 241 adults with ADPKD and preserved renal function. Magnetic resonance imaging and iothalamate clearance were used to measure htTKV and GFR, respectively. The association between baseline htTKV and the attainment of stage 3 CKD (GFR {$<$}60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) during follow-up was determined.
Results After a mean follow-up of 7.9 years, stage 3 CKD was attained in 30.7\% of the enrollees. Using baseline htTKV, negative correlations with GFR increased from -0.22 at baseline to -0.65 at year 8. In multivariable analysis, a baseline htTKV increase of 100 cc/m significantly predicted the development of CKD within 8 years with an odds ratio of 1.48 (95\% confidence interval: 1.29, 1.70). In receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, baseline htTKV of 600 cc/m most accurately defined the risk of developing stage 3 CKD within 8 years with an area under the curve of 0.84 (95\% confidence interval: 0.79, 0.90). htTKV was a better predictor than baseline age, serum creatinine, BUN, urinary albumin, or monocyte chemotactic protein-1 excretion (P{$<$}0.05).
Conclusions Baseline htTKV {$\geq$}600 cc/m predicted the risk of developing renal insufficiency in ADPKD patients at high risk for renal disease progression within 8 years of follow-up, qualifying htTKV as a prognostic biomarker in ADPKD.},

  abstract = {The objective of this magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was to (1) test the validity of the ellipsoid formula for estimating kidney volume using ex vivo and in vivo models and (2) establish a normal range of values for kidney length and volume in patients with no known history of renal disease. The volumes of five excised porcine kidneys were measured by (1) disc-summation method, (2) ellipsoid formula, and (3) water displacement method. In a retrospective, consecutive group of clinically referred patients (n = 150; 300 kidneys), individual kidney volume and length were calculated by the disc-summation method and by multiplanar reformation of MRI data, respectively. For comparison, kidney volumes also were calculated using the ellipsoid formula in all patients. Renal volume that was obtained by MRI using the disc-summation method was within 5\% of the volume that was determined by the water displacement method, independent of the spatial resolution of the MRI technique used. Data from both the in vivo and the ex vivo models revealed that the ellipsoid formula that commonly is used in ultrasonography underestimates renal volume by 17 to 29\% compared with the disc-summation method (P {$<$} 0.05). As measured by MRI (mean {$\pm$} SD), kidney lengths were 12.4 {$\pm$} 0.9 cm for men and 11.6 {$\pm$} 1.1 cm for women, and kidney volumes were 202 {$\pm$} 36 ml for men and 154 {$\pm$} 33 ml for women. The results from the ex vivo MRI study show that the kidney volume that was obtained using the disc-summation method is within 5\% of the true kidney volume as measured by the water displacement method. The ellipsoid formula consistently and significantly underestimates the true kidney volume. The length and the volume of kidneys that are obtained by MRI in patients with no known history of intrinsic renal disease are greater than the commonly quoted reference values that are obtained by ultrasonography.},

Theory and Methods 3D multi-echo gradient echo imaging and perfusion imaging with arterial spin labeling were performed in 11 healthy subjects. CMRO2 and OEF maps were reconstructed by joint quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to process GRE phases and quantitative blood oxygen level-dependent (qBOLD) modeling to process GRE magnitudes. Comparisons with QSM and qBOLD alone were performed using ROI analysis, paired t-tests, and Bland-Altman plot. Results The average CMRO2 value in cortical gray matter across subjects were 140.4 {$\pm$} 14.9, 134.1 {$\pm$} 12.5, and 184.6 {$\pm$} 17.9 {$\mu$}mol/100 g/min, with corresponding OEFs of 30.9 {$\pm$} 3.4\%, 30.0 {$\pm$} 1.8\%, and 40.9 {$\pm$} 2.4\% for methods based on QSM, qBOLD, and QSM+qBOLD, respectively. QSM+qBOLD provided the highest CMRO2 contrast between gray and white matter, more uniform OEF than QSM, and less noisy OEF than qBOLD. Conclusion Quantitative CMRO2 mapping that fits the entire complex GRE data is feasible by combining QSM analysis of phase and qBOLD analysis of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study was to correlate total renal volume (TRV) calculations, obtained through the voxel-count method and ellipsoid formula with various physical characteristics.
Materials and methods
MRI reports and physical examination from 210 healthy kidney donors (420 kidneys), on whom renal volumes were obtained using the voxel-count method, were retrospectively reviewed. These values along with ones obtained through a more traditional method (ellipsoid formula) were correlated with subject height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), and age.
Results
TRV correlated strongly with body weight (r=0.7) and to a lesser degree with height, age, or BMI (r=0.5, -0.2, 0.3, respectively). The left kidney volume was greater than the right, on average (p{$<$}0.001). The ellipsoid formula method over-estimated renal volume by 17\% on average which was significant (p{$<$}0.001).
Conclusions
Body weight was the physical characteristic which demonstrated the strongest correlation with renal volume in healthy subjects. Given this finding, a formula was derived for estimating the TRV for a given patient based on the his or her weight: TRV=2.96\texttimes{}weight (kg)+113{$\pm$}64.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total [Na] sodium was determined from the ratio of the relaxation-corrected 23Na signal intensities measured from short echo-time (0.4 msec) 23Na images to those from an external saline solution reference. The method was validated with the blinded use of saline solutions of varying sodium concentrations. [Na] was measured in the calf muscles in 10 healthy volunteers. 23Na MR imaging also was performed in two healthy subjects after exercise, two patients with myotonic dystrophy, and two patients with osteoarthritis. RESULTS:23Na MR imaging yielded a total [Na] value of 28.4 mmol/kg of wet weight~{$\pm{}~$}3.6 (SD) in normal muscle, consistent with prior biopsy data. Spatial resolution was 0.22 mL, with signal-to-noise ratio of 10\textendash{}15. Mean signal intensity elevations were 16\% and 22\% after exercise and 47\% and 70\% in dystrophic muscles compared with those at normal resting levels. In osteoarthritis, mean signal intensity reductions were 36\% and 15\% compared with those in unaffected knee joints. CONCLUSION:23Na MR imaging can be used to quantify total [Na] in human muscle. The technique may facilitate understanding of the role of the sodium-potassium pump and perfusion in normal and diseased muscle.},

METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 15,625 noninstitutionalized adults aged 20 years and older from the NHANES III was analyzed. Kidney function (GFR), kidney damage (albuminuria), and stages of CKD (GFR and albuminuria) were estimated from calibrated serum creatinine level, spot urine albumin level, age, sex, and race. GFR was estimated using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation and compared with the Cockcroft-Gault equation for creatinine clearance (CCr).
RESULTS: The prevalence of CKD in the US adult population was 11\% (19.2 million). By stage, an estimated 5.9 million individuals (3.3\%) had stage 1 (persistent albuminuria with a normal GFR), 5.3 million (3.0\%) had stage 2 (persistent albuminuria with a GFR of 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), 7.6 million (4.3\%) had stage 3 (GFR, 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), 400,000 individuals (0.2\%) had stage 4 (GFR, 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), and 300,000 individuals (0.2\%) had stage 5, or kidney failure. Aside from hypertension and diabetes, age is a key predictor of CKD, and 11\% of individuals older than 65 years without hypertension or diabetes had stage 3 or worse CKD. Compared with GFR estimates, CCr estimates showed a steeper decline with age and were lower in non-Hispanic blacks.
CONCLUSION: CKD is common and warrants improved detection and classification using standardized criteria to improve outcomes. Am J Kidney Dis 41:1-12.},

Materials and Methods Sixteen kidneys in eight pigs were imaged with a multiphasic contrast-enhanced fast three-dimensional sequence on a 1.5-T imager. Kidney segmentation, followed by a process of signal intensity thresholding for cortical and nephrographic phase datasets, allowed for MRI measurements of parenchymal volume and medullary fraction. Autopsy provided reference standards of renal volume, weight, and medullary fraction. Results An excellent correlation was found between MRI measurement of total renal parenchymal volume and autopsy volume (R2 = 0.86) and weight (R2 = 0.90). Medullary fraction (mean {$\pm$} SD) measured with MRI was 0.120 {$\pm$} 0.067, and with autopsy was 0.116 {$\pm$} 0.025 (t-test P = 0.84, F-test P = 0.001).

  abstract = {Background: This paper outlines a multiparametric renal MRI acquisition and analysis protocol to allow non-invasive assessment of haemodynamics (renal artery blood flow and perfusion), oxygenation (BOLD T2*) and microstructure (diffusion, T1 mapping). Methods: We use our multiparametric renal MRI protocol to provide 1) a comprehensive set of MRI parameters (renal artery and vein blood flow, perfusion, T1, T2*, diffusion (ADC, D, D*, fp) and total kidney volume) in a large cohort of healthy participants (127 participants with mean age of 41 {$\pm$} 19 years) and show the MR field strength (1.5 T versus 3 T) dependence of T1 and T2* relaxation times; 2) the repeatability of multiparametric MRI measures in eleven healthy participants; 3) changes in MRI measures in response to hypercapnic and hyperoxic modulations in six healthy participants; and 4) pilot data showing the application of the multiparametric protocol in eleven patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Results: Baseline measures were in-line with literature values, and as expected, T1 values were longer at 3 T compared with 1.5 T, with increased T1 corticomedullary differentiation at 3 T. Conversely, T2* was longer at 1.5 T. Inter-scan coefficients of variation (CoVs) of T1 mapping and ADC were very good at {$<$}2.9 \%. Intra class correlations (ICCs) were high for cortex perfusion (0.801), cortex and medulla T1 (0.848 and 0.997 using SE-EPI), and renal artery flow (0.844). In response to hypercapnia, a decrease in cortex T2* was observed, whilst no significant effect of hyperoxia on T2* was found. In CKD patients, renal artery and vein blood flow, and renal perfusion was lower than for healthy participants. Renal cortex and medulla T1 was significantly higher in CKD patients compared to healthy participants, with corticomedullary T1 differentiation reduced in CKD patients compared to healthy participants. No significant difference was found in renal T2*. Conclusions: Multiparametric MRI is a powerful technique for the assessment of changes in structure, haemodynamics and oxygenation in a single scan session. This protocol provides the potential to assess the pathophysiological mechanisms in various aetiologies of renal disease, and to assess the efficacy of drug treatments.},

This is a hypothesis-generating pilot study assessing the effect of nephrectomy on renal function in healthy kidney donors.MethodsEight living kidney donors underwent arterial spin labelling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and GFR measurement prior to and 1 year after nephrectomy. Chromium-51 labelled ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA) with multi-blood sampling was undertaken and GFR calculated. The RBF and GFR obtained were used to calculate FF.ResultsAll donors showed an increase in single kidney GFR of 24 \textendash{} 75 \%, and all but two showed an increase in FF (-7 to +52 \%) after nephrectomy. The increase in RBF, and hence RPF, post-nephrectomy was not as great as the increase in GFR in seven out of eight donors. As with any pilot study, the small number of donors and their relatively narrow age range are potential limiting factors.ConclusionsThe ability to measure RBF, and hence RPF, non-invasively, coupled with GFR measurement, allows calculation of FF, a biomarker that might provide a sensitive indicator of loss of renal reserve in potential donors.Key Points\textbullet{} Non-invasive MRI measured renal blood flow and calculated renal plasma flow. \textbullet{} Effect of nephrectomy on blood flow and filtration in donors is presented. \textbullet{} Calculated filtration fraction may be a useful new kidney biomarker.},

  abstract = {Unlike in vivo imaging, postmortem MRI allows for invasive examination of the tissue specimen immediately after the MR scan. However, natural tissue decomposition and chemical fixation cause the postmortem tissue's MRI properties to be different from those found in vivo. Moreover, these properties change as postmortem fixation time elapses. The goal of this study was to characterize the T2 relaxation changes that occur over time in cadaveric human brain hemispheres during fixation. Five hemispheres immersed in formaldehyde solution were scanned on a weekly basis for 3 months postmortem, and once again at 6 months postmortem. The T2 relaxation times were measured throughout the hemispheres. Over time, T2 values near the edges of the hemispheres decreased rapidly after death, while T2 values of deep tissue decreased more slowly. This difference is likely due to the relatively large distance from the hemisphere surface, and other barriers limiting diffusion of formaldehyde molecules to deep tissues. In addition, T2 values in deep tissue did not continuously decay to a plateau, but instead reached a minimum and then increased to a plateau. This final increase may be due to the effects of prolonged tissue decomposition, a hypothesis that is supported by numerical simulations of the fixation process.

Six images were acquired during one breath hold with a half-Fourier acquisition single-shot fast SE sequence. Signal intensities in regions of interest were fit to theoretical curves. Measurements were performed at 1.5 and 3.0 T. Relaxation times at 1.5 T were compared with those reported in the literature by using a one-sample t test. Differences in mean relaxation time between 1.5 and 3.0 T were analyzed with a two-sample paired t test.RESULTS: Relaxation times (mean {$\pm$} SD) at 3.0 T are reported for kidney cortex (T1, 1,142 msec {$\pm$} 154; T2, 76 msec {$\pm$} 7), kidney medulla (T1, 1,545 msec {$\pm$} 142; T2, 81 msec {$\pm$} 8), liver (T1, 809 msec {$\pm$} 71; T2, 34 msec {$\pm$} 4), spleen (T1, 1,328 msec {$\pm$} 31; T2, 61 msec {$\pm$} 9), pancreas (T1, 725 msec {$\pm$} 71; T2, 43 msec {$\pm$} 7), paravertebral muscle (T1, 898 msec {$\pm$} 33; T2, 29 msec {$\pm$} 4), bone marrow in L4 vertebra (T1, 586 msec {$\pm$} 73; T2, 49 msec {$\pm$} 4), subcutaneous fat (T1, 382 msec {$\pm$} 13; T2, 68 msec {$\pm$} 4), prostate (T1, 1,597 msec {$\pm$} 42; T2, 74 msec {$\pm$} 9), myometrium (T1, 1,514 msec {$\pm$} 156; T2, 79 msec {$\pm$} 10), endometrium (T1, 1,453 msec {$\pm$} 123; T2, 59 msec {$\pm$} 1), and cervix (T1, 1,616 msec {$\pm$} 61; T2, 83 msec {$\pm$} 7). On average, T1 relaxation times were 21\% longer (P {$<$} .05) for kidney cortex, liver, and spleen and T2 relaxation times were 8\% shorter (P {$<$} .05) for liver, spleen, and fat at 3.0 T; however, the fractional change in T1 and T2 relaxation times varied greatly with the organ. At 1.5 T, no significant differences (P {$>$} .05) in T1 relaxation time between the results of this study and the results of other studies for liver, kidney, spleen, and muscle tissue were found.CONCLUSION: T1 relaxation times are generally higher and T2 relaxation times are generally lower at 3.0 T than at 1.5 T, but the magnitude of change varies greatly in different tissues.\textcopyright{} RSNA, 2004},

The second survey was expanded to include both T1 and T2 mapping, and consisted of 54 items of which 32 reached consensus. Recommendations based were formulated on hardware, patient preparation, acquisition, analysis and reporting. Consensus-based technical recommendations for renal T1 and T2 mapping were formulated. However, there was considerable lack of consensus for renal T1 and particularly renal T2 mapping, to some extent surprising considering the long history of relaxometry in MRI, highlighting key knowledge gaps that require further work. This paper should be regarded as a first step in a long-term evidence-based iterative process towards ever increasing harmonization of scan protocols across sites, to ultimately facilitate clinical implementation.},

  abstract = {BackgroundUreteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction is a common cause of renal injury in children. Indications for surgery are still controversial. Currently, there is no threshold to differentiate patients with suspected UPJ obstruction requiring surgery from the ones that do not, or to predict renal outcome after surgery. Several studies have demonstrated that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) results may correlate with microstructural changes in the kidneys.ObjectiveTo evaluate the feasibility of using DTI to identify UPJ obstruction kidneys.Materials and methodsWe analyzed functional MR urography (fMRU) with renal DTI (b=0 and b=400, 20 directions, 1.5 Tesla, no respiratory triggering) in 26 kidneys of 19 children (mean age: 6.15 years) by comparing 13 kidneys with UPJ obstruction configuration that underwent pyeloplasty following the fMRU, and 13 anatomically normal age- and gender-matched kidneys. DTI tractography was reconstructed using a fractional anisotropy threshold of 0.10 and an angle threshold of 55\textdegree. User-defined regions of interest (ROIs) of the renal parenchyma (excluding collecting system) were drawn to quantify DTI parameters: fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), track length and track volume. The failure rate was evaluated.ResultsAll DTI parameters changed with age; fractional anisotropy decreased (P{$<$}0.032). Track volume and track length increased (P{$<$}0.05). ADC increased with age in normal kidneys (P{$<$}0.001) but not in UPJ obstruction kidneys (P=0.11). After controlling for age, the fractional anisotropy (UPJ obstruction mean: 0.18, normal kidney mean: 0.21; P=0.001) and track length (UPJ obstruction mean: 11.9 mm, normal kidney mean: 15.4 mm; P{$<$}0.001) were lower in UPJ obstruction vs. normal kidneys. There was a trend toward a higher ADC in UPJ obstruction kidneys vs. normal kidneys (P=0.062). The failure rate in UPJ obstruction kidneys due to technical limitations of DTI was 13/26 (50\%).ConclusionWe demonstrated that fractional anisotropy is lower in UPJ obstruction than in normal kidneys. It is necessary to improve this technique to increase the success rate and to perform more studies to evaluate if a decrease in fractional anisotropy can differentiate UPJ obstruction kidneys from hydronephrotic kidneys without UPJ obstruction.},

Eight healthy volunteers underwent 2D multi-gradient echo MR imaging at 1.5\,T and 3.0\,T. Parametrical T2* relaxation time maps were computed and average T2* was measured in regions of interest placed in the renal medulla and cortex. The largest T2* changes were measured in the renal medulla, with a relative {$\increment$}T2* of 33.8\,{$\pm$}\,22.0\% (right medulla) and 34.7\,{$\pm$}\,17.6\% (left medulla) as compared to room air for oxygen breathing (p\,{$>$}\,0.01), and 53.8\,{$\pm$}\,23.9\% and 53.5\,{$\pm$}\,33.9\% (p\,{$<$}\,0.01) for carbogen breathing, respectively at 3\,T.

As a result, we showed that renal medullary T2* times responded strongly to inhalation of hyperoxic gases, which may be attributed to the hypoxic condition of the medulla and subsequent reduction in deoxyhemoglobin.

In 25 patients who had received diuretics for 2-14 years the mean concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and sodium-potassium pumps were measured in skeletal muscle biopsy specimens and were significantly lower than in those from a group of age matched controls. The reductions in all three variables were significant in those patients receiving diuretics for arterial hypertension as well as in those being treated for congestive heart failure. In 14 patients the mean muscle potassium concentration was below the control range, but only one of those was hypokalaemic (3{$\cdot$}4 mmol/l), and 13 were receiving potassium supplements. In 15 patients the mean muscle magnesium concentration was below normal, and the mean muscle potassium and magnesium concentrations showed a linear correlation. In 12 patients in whom the mean muscle potassium concentration was below 80 {$\mu$}mol/g wet weight there was a linear correlation between the cellular potassium:sodium ratio and the concentration of 3H-ouabain binding sites indicating that potassium deficiency also leads to a down regulation of sodium-potassium pumps in human skeletal muscle., In spite of potassium supplements long term treatment with diuretics may lead to potassium and magnesium deficiencies, which are not detectable using the standard methods of serum analysis. The changes in concentrations of electrolytes and sodium-potassium pumps associated with treatment with diuretics may impair muscle function and potassium homoeostasis and interfere with the distribution of digitalis glycosides.},

Follow-up was for a mean of 5.5 years for survival, cause of death, and acceptance to renal replacement therapy (RRT). The annual incidence rate of detected CKD was 1,701 per million population (pmp; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1,613 to 1,793) and 1,071 pmp (95\% CI, 1,001 to 1,147) in those younger than 80 years. There was a steep age gradient; median age was 77 years. The man-woman rate ratio was 1.6 (95\% CI, 1.4 to 1.8), with a male excess in all age groups older than 40 years. Incidence increased in areas with greater socioeconomic deprivation. Median survival was 35 months. Age, SCr level, and deprivation index were all significantly associated with survival. Standardized mortality ratios were 36-fold in those aged 16 to 49 years, 12-fold in those aged 50 to 64 years, and more than 2-fold in those older than 65 years. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was the most common cause of death (46\%). Only 4\% of patients were accepted to RRT. The incidence of diagnosed CKD is common, especially in the elderly, and is greater in more deprived areas. Prognosis is poor, with CVD prominent. More research is needed to assess the effectiveness and costs of increasing referral to nephrologists of patients with CKD.},

  abstract = {The measurement of venous cerebral blood oxygenation (Yv) has potential applications in the study of patient groups where oxygen extraction and/or metabolism are compromised. It is also useful for fMRI studies to assess the stimulus-induced changes in Yv, particularly since basal Yv partially accounts for inter-subject variation in the haemodynamic response to a stimulus. A range of MRI-based methods of measuring Yv have been developed recently. Here, we use a method based on the change in phase in the MR image arising from the field perturbation caused by deoxygenated haemoglobin in veins. We build on the existing phase based approach (Method I), where Yv is measured in a large vein (such as the superior sagittal sinus) based on the field shift inside the vein with assumptions as to the vein's shape and orientation. We demonstrate two novel modifications which address limitations of this method. The first modification (Method II), maps the actual form of the vein, rather than assume a given shape and orientation. The second modification (Method III) uses the intra and perivascular phase change in response to a known change in Yv on hyperoxia to measure normoxic Yv in smaller veins. Method III can be applied to veins whose shape, size and orientation are not accurately known, thus allowing more localised measures of venous oxygenation. Results demonstrate that the use of an overly fine spatial filter caused an overestimation in Yv for Method I, whilst the measurement of Yv using Method II was less sensitive to this bias, giving Yv = 0.62 {$\pm$} 0.03. Method III was applied to mapping of Yv in local veins across the brain, yielding a distribution of values with a mode of Yv = 0.661 {$\pm$} 0.008.},

  abstract = {Purpose:
In this work, a generic recipe for an inexpensive and nontoxic phantom was developed within a range of biologically relevant dielectric properties from 150 MHz to 4.5 GHz.

Methods:
The recipe includes deionized water as the solvent, NaCl to primarily control conductivity, sucrose to primarily control permittivity, agar\textendash{}agar to gel the solution and reduce heat diffusivity, and benzoic acid to preserve the gel. Two hundred and seventeen samples were prepared to cover the feasible range of NaCl and sucrose concentrations. Their dielectric properties were measured using a commercial dielectric probe and were fitted to a 3D polynomial to generate a recipe describing the properties as a function of NaCl concentration, sucrose concentration, and frequency.

Results:
Results indicated that the intuitive linear and independent relationships between NaCl and conductivity and between sucrose and permittivity are not valid. A generic polynomial recipe was developed to characterize the complex relationship between the solutes and the resulting dielectric values and has been made publicly available as a web application. In representative mixtures developed to mimic brain and muscle tissue, less than 2\% difference was observed between the predicted and measured conductivity and permittivity values.

Conclusions:
It is expected that the recipe will be useful for generating dielectric phantoms for general magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coil development at high magnetic field strength, including coil safety evaluation as well as pulse sequence evaluation (including B1+ mapping, B1+ shimming, and selective excitation pulse design), and other non-MRI applications which require biologically equivalent dielectric properties.},

Increasing evidence exists that molecular therapeutic strategies targeted to cyst formation and growth might be more efficacious in early disease stages, highlighting the growing need for sensitive biomarkers. Here we apply quantitative magnetic resonance imaging techniques of T2 mapping and diffusion-weighted imaging in the jck mouse model for PKD using a clinical 3.0 T scanner. We tested whether kidney T2 values and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) are superior to anatomical imaging parameters in the detection of early cystogenesis, as shown on macro- and histopathology. We also tested whether kidney T2 values and ADC have the potential to monitor early treatment effects of therapy with the V2 receptor antagonist Mozavaptane. Kidney T2 values and to a lesser degree ADC were found to be highly sensitive markers of early cystogenesis and superior to anatomical-based imaging parameters. Furthermore, kidney T2 values exhibited a nearly perfect correlation to the histological cystic index, allowing a clear separation of the two mouse genotypes. Additionally, kidney T2 values and ADC were able to monitor early treatment effects in the jck mouse model in a proof-of-principle experiment. Thus, given the superiority of kidney T2 values and ADC over anatomical-based imaging in mice, further studies are needed to evaluate the translational impact of these techniques in patients with PKD.},

Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) technique, for Apparent Diffusion Coefficient
(ADC), were first compared to renal fibrosis in two well-controlled animal models to
assess detection limits. Validation against biopsy was then performed in 33 kidney
allograft recipients (KARs). Predictive MRI indices, {$\Delta$}T1 and
{$\Delta$}ADC (defined as the cortico-medullary differences), were compared to
histology. In rats, both T1 and ADC correlated well with fibrosis and inflammation
showing a difference between normal and diseased kidneys. In KARs, MRI indices were
not sensitive to interstitial inflammation. By contrast, {$\Delta$}ADC
outperformed {$\Delta$}T1 with a stronger negative correlation to fibrosis
(R2\,=\,0.64 against
R2\,=\,0.29

in KARs harboring cortical fibrosis of more than 40\%. Using a discriminant analysis
method, the {$\Delta$}ADC, as a marker to detect such level of fibrosis or
higher, led to a specificity and sensitivity of 100\% and 71\%, respectively. This new

To characterize
T2* and T1 relaxation time response to a wide spectrum of gas challenges in extracranial tissues of healthy rats.

Materials and Methods

A range of graded gas mixtures (hyperoxia, hypercapnia, hypoxia, and hypercapnic hypoxia) were delivered through a controlled gas-mixing circuit to mechanically ventilated and intubated rats. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a 3T clinical scanner;
T2* and T1 maps were computed to determine tissue response in the liver, kidney cortex, and paraspinal muscles. Heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) were measured through a rodent oximeter and physiological monitor.

Results

T2* decreases consistent with lowered SaO2 measurements were observed for hypercapnia and hypoxia, but decreases were significant only in liver and kidney cortex (P {$<$} 0.05) for {$>$}10\% CO2 and {$<$}15\% O2, with the new gas stimulus, hypercapnic hypoxia, producing the greatest
T2* decrease. Hyperoxia-related
T2* increases were accompanied by negligible increases in SaO2. T1 generally increased, if at all, in the liver and decreased in the kidney. Significance was observed (P {$<$} 0.05) only in kidney for {$>$}90\% O2 and {$>$}5\% CO2.

Conclusion

T2* and T1 provide complementary roles for evaluating extracranial tissue response to a broad range of gas challenges. Based on both measured and known physiological responses, our results are consistent with
T2* as a sensitive marker of blood oxygen saturation and T1 as a weak marker of blood volume changes. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016;44:305\textendash{}316.},

Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations forall the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface.We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as thediffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition,cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such asconstrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging withdeconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and originalmethods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions areprovided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as wellas file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of noveltechniques.In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not beingdeveloped by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project thatencourages contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and opendiscussions on the project mailing list.

Cortical and medullary regions of interest (ROIs) were located to obtain the corresponding values of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the fractional anisotropy (FA). The mean values of the ADC and FA, for each ROI site, were obtained in each group and were compared. Furthermore, the correlations between the diffusion parameters and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were determined.ResultsIn both the normal and affected kidneys, we obtained the cortico-medullary difference of the ADC and the FA values. The FA value in the medulla was significantly lower (P = 0.0149) in patients with renal function impairment as compared to patients with normal renal function. A direct correlation between DTI parameters and the eGFR was not found. Tractography visualised disruption of the regular arrangement of the tracts in patient with renal function alteration.ConclusionDTI could be a useful tool in the evaluation of chronic kidney disease and, in particular, the medullary FA value seems to be the main parameter for assessing renal damage.Key Points\textbullet{} Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (MRDTI) provides new information about renal problems. \textbullet{} DTI allows non-invasive repeatable evaluation of the renal parenchyma, without contrast media. \textbullet{} DTI could become useful in the management of chronic parenchymal disease. \textbullet{} DTI seems more appropriate for renal evaluation than diffusion-weighted imaging.},

We developed a 3-D segmentation framework for fully automatic kidney parenchyma volumetry that uses Bayesian concepts for probability map generation. The probability map quality is improved in a multistep refinement approach. An extended prior shape level set segmentation method is then applied on the refined probability maps. The segmentation quality is improved by incorporating an exterior cortex edge alignment technique using cortex probability maps. In contrast to previous approaches, we combine several relevant kidney parenchyma features in a sequence of segmentation techniques for successful parenchyma delineation on native MR datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method is able to recognize and exclude parenchymal cysts from the parenchymal volume. We analyzed four different quality measures showing better results for right parenchymal tissue than for left parenchymal tissue due to an incorporated liver part removal in the segmentation framework. The results show that the outer cortex edge alignment approach successfully improves the quality measures.},

However, this technique suffers from the problems of the transfer insensitive labeling technique upon which it is based. In particular, RPI is very sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneities, and therefore the definition of the labeled bolus can deteriorate at field strength higher than 1.5 T. Furthermore, the slab-selective triple-pulse postsaturation sequence used originally will also be impaired due to the same problem, rendering RPI unusable at higher field. In this work, an adiabatic-based signal targeting with alternating radiofrequency pulses sequence is proposed as a labeling scheme to solve the problems related to variations in local magnetic field, together with an improved four-pulse water suppression enhanced through T1 effects technique as a presaturation scheme.

The magnetization transfer insensitive labeling technique (TILT) has been used for mapping blood flow changes at a microvascular level under motor activation in a multislice mode. In TILT, perfusion mapping is achieved by subtraction of a perfusion-sensitized image from a control image. Perfusion weighting is accomplished by proximal blood labeling using two 90\textdegree{} radiofrequency excitation pulses. For control preparation the labeling pulses are modified such that they have no net effect on blood water magnetization. The percentage of blood flow change, as well as its spatial extent, has been studied in single and multislice modes with varying delays between labeling and imaging. The average perfusion signal change due to activation was 36.9 {$\pm$} 9.1\% in the single-slice experiments and 38.1 {$\pm$} 7.9\% in the multislice experiments. The volume of activated brain areas amounted to 1.51 {$\pm$} 0.95 cm3 in the contralateral primary motor (M1) area, 0.90 {$\pm$} 0.72 cc in the ipsilateral M1 area, 1.27 {$\pm$} 0.39 cm3 in the contralateral and 1.42 {$\pm$} 0.75 cm3 in the ipsilateral premotor areas, and 0.71 {$\pm$} 0.19 cm3 in the supplementary motor area.J.

In the knees of five healthy volunteers, we measured the T1 and T2 relaxation times of cartilage, synovial fluid, muscle, marrow, and fat at 1.5 and 3.0 T. The T1 relaxation times were measured using a spiral Look-Locker sequence with eight samples along the T1 recovery curve. The T2 relaxation times were measured using a spiral T2 preparation sequence with six echoes. Accuracy and repeatability of the T1 and T2 measurement sequences were verified in phantoms.RESULTS. T1 relaxation times in cartilage, muscle, synovial fluid, marrow, and subcutaneous fat at 3.0 T were consistently higher than those measured at 1.5 T. Measured T2 relaxation times were reduced at 3.0 T compared with 1.5 T. Relaxation time measurements in vivo were verified using calculated and measured signal-to-noise results. Relaxation times were used to develop a high-resolution protocol for T2-weighted imaging of the knee at 3.0 T.CONCLUSION. MRI at 3.0 T can improve resolution and speed in musculoskeletal imaging; however, interactions between field strength and relaxation times need to be considered for optimal image contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. Scanning can be performed in shorter times at 3.0 T using single-average acquisitions. Efficient higher-resolution imaging at 3.0 T can be done by increasing the TR to account for increased T1 relaxation times and acquiring thinner slices than at 1.5 T.},

  abstract = {Purpose
We measured kidney volume using software and investigated the relationship between kidney volume and renal function.
Materials and Methods
Age, gender, height, body weight, body mass index, body surface area and serum creatinine were recorded for 539 normal individuals. A tissue segmentation tool program was used to measure kidney volume from computerized tomography images. The glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation and an abbreviated modification of diet in renal disease equation. We looked for correlations of renal parenchymal volume with age and anthropometric measurements. We also tested for a correlation between kidney volume and renal function using the glomerular filtration rate according to the Cockcroft-Gault and modification of diet in renal disease equations.
Results
Mean kidney volume in all participants was 261.3 {$\pm$} 58.1 ml. Mean volume in men was approximately 14 ml greater than in women (266.1 vs 251.8 ml, p = 0.004). Kidney volume correlated significantly with height (r = 0.344, p \&lt;0.001), body weight (r = 0.343, p \&lt;0.001), body mass index (r = 0.177, p \&lt;0.001), body surface area (r = 0.371, p \&lt;0.001) and age (r = -0.418, p \&lt;0.001). Kidney volume also correlated with the glomerular filtration rate according to the Cockcroft-Gault and modification of diet in renal disease equations (p \&lt;0.001, r = 0.615 and p \&lt;0.001, r = 0.432, respectively). Kidney volume and the glomerular filtration rate decreased in parallel with increasing age.
Conclusions
Kidney volume correlates well with renal function and anthropometric measurements. Knowledge of these relationships will be valuable in clinical urology and nephrology.},

We investigated the progressive changes in T1 and T2 relaxation times, and the arrangement of locally prevailing cardiomyocyte orientation determined using diffusion tensor imaging, in embedded ex vivo rat hearts fixed using Karnovsky's solution (glutaraldehyde\textendash{}formaldehyde mix). Three embedding media were investigated: (i) standard agarose (n = 3 hearts); (ii) Fomblin (n = 4 hearts); and (iii) iso-osmotic agarose (n = 3 hearts); in the latter, the osmolarity of the fixative and embedding medium was adjusted to 300 mOsm to match more closely that of native tissue. The T1 relaxation time in the myocardium showed a pronounced decrease over a 48-h period following embedding in Fomblin (-11.3 {$\pm$} 6.2\%; mean {$\pm$} standard deviation), but was stable in standard agarose- and iso-osmotic agarose-embedded hearts. The mean myocardial T2 relaxation time increased in all embedded hearts: by 35.1 {$\pm$} 14.7\% with standard agarose embedding, 13.1 {$\pm$} 5.6\% with Fomblin and 13.3 {$\pm$} 1.4\% with iso-osmotic agarose. Deviation in the orientation of the primary eigenvector of the diffusion tensor occurred in all hearts (mean angular changes of 6.6\textdegree, 3.2\textdegree{} and 1.9\textdegree{} per voxel after 48 h in agarose-, Fomblin- and iso-osmotic agarose-embedded hearts, respectively), indicative of progressive structural changes in myocardial histo-architecture, in spite of previous exposure to fast-acting tissue fixation. Our results suggest that progressive structural changes occur in chemically fixed myocardium, and that the extent of these changes is modulated by the embedding medium, and by osmotic gradients between the fixative in the tissue and the surrounding medium.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In recent years, several high-resolution vessel wall MR imaging techniques have emerged for the characterization of intracranial atherosclerotic vessel wall lesions in vivo. However, a thorough validation of MR imaging results of intracranial plaques with histopathology is still lacking. The aim of this study was to characterize atherosclerotic plaque components in a quantitative manner by obtaining the MR signal characteristics (T1, T2, T2*, and proton density) at 7T in ex vivo circle of Willis specimens and using histopathology for validation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multiparametric ultra-high-resolution quantitative MR imaging protocol was performed at 7T to identify the MR signal characteristics of different intracranial atherosclerotic plaque components, and using histopathology for validation. In total, 38 advanced plaques were matched between MR imaging and histology, and ROI analysis was performed on the identified tissue components.
RESULTS: Mean T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times and proton density values were significantly different between different tissue components. The quantitative T1 map showed the most differences among individual tissue components of intracranial plaques with significant differences in T1 values between lipid accumulation (T1 = 838 {$\pm$} 167 ms), fibrous tissue (T1 = 583 {$\pm$} 161 ms), fibrous cap (T1 = 481 {$\pm$} 98 ms), calcifications (T1 = 314 {$\pm$} 39 ms), and the intracranial arterial vessel wall (T1 = 436 {$\pm$} 122 ms).
CONCLUSIONS: Different tissue components of advanced intracranial plaques have distinguishable imaging characteristics with ultra-high-resolution quantitative MR imaging at 7T. Based on this study, the most promising method for distinguishing intracranial plaque components is T1-weighted imaging.},

Mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated separately for the cortex and for the medulla and compared between healthy and transplanted kidneys. Furthermore, the correlation between diffusion parameters and estimated GFR was determined.ResultsThe ADC in the cortex and in the medulla were lower in transplanted than in healthy kidneys (p {$<$} 0.01). Differences were more distinct for FA, especially in the renal medulla, with a significant reduction in allografts (p {$<$} 0.001). Furthermore, in transplanted patients a correlation between mean FA in the medulla and estimated GFR was observed (r = 0.72, p {$<$} 0.01).

Portal blood flow and hepatic tissue oxygenation were measured using a transonic flowmeter and near infrared spectroscopy while gas analysis was carried out on portal venous blood samples. The effects of breathing 13\%, 21\%, 50\%, or 100\% oxygen were compared in animals with steptozotocin-induced diabetes and in controls. In diabetic rats breathing 21\% oxygen, portal blood flow was significantly lower than in controls (7.2+/-0.7 vs. 9.1+/-0.8 ml/min, p {$<$} 0.05). In both groups, breathing 100\% oxygen significantly increased portal flow (to 8.4+/-1.0 and 12.2+/-0.7 ml/min, respectively). This effect was not secondary to hepatic arterial vasoconstriction because it was not prevented by hepatic artery ligation. In controls, breathing 100\% oxygen increased portal pO2 from 5.0+/-0.9 to 14.4+/-1.4 kPa (p {$<$} 0.05) and portal venous oxygen saturation (PSaO2) from 53.9+/-12.1\% to 92.9+/-1.4\% (p {$<$} 0.05), a value not significantly different from peripheral (arterial) saturation. Similarly, in diabetic animals pO2 rose from 5.6+/-0.3 to 11.7+/-0.4 kPa (p {$<$} 0.01) and SO2 from 55.5+/-5.2\% to 88.5+/-0.6\% (p {$<$} 0.05). Hepatic oxyhemoglobin rose and deoxyhemoglobin fell reciprocally as a function of the inspired oxygen concentration. Improved hepatic oxygenation observed in animals breathing oxygen-enriched gas mixtures results from an increase in splanchnic blood flow coupled with a marked increase in portal oxygen saturation. This effective arterialization of portal blood may have important consequences for the success of intraportal transplantation of pancreatic islets.},

  abstract = {Neonatal congenital heart disease (CHD) is associated with altered cerebral hemodynamics and increased risk of brain injury. Two novel noninvasive techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffuse optical and correlation spectroscopies (diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS), diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS)), were employed to quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism (CMRO2) of 32 anesthetized CHD neonates at rest and during hypercapnia. Cerebral venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and CBF were measured simultaneously with MRI in the superior sagittal sinus, yielding global oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and global CMRO2 in physiologic units. In addition, microvascular tissue oxygenation (StO2) and indices of microvascular CBF (BFI) and CMRO2 (CMRO2i) in the frontal cortex were determined by DOS/DCS. Median resting-state MRI-measured OEF, CBF, and CMRO2 were 0.38, 9.7\,mL/minute per 100\,g and 0.52\,mL O2/minute per 100\,g, respectively. These CBF and CMRO2 values are lower than literature reports for healthy term neonates (which are sparse and quantified using different methods) and resemble values reported for premature infants. Comparison of MRI measurements of global SvO2, CBF, and CMRO2 with corresponding local DOS/DCS measurements demonstrated strong linear correlations (R2=0.69, 0.67, 0.67; P{$<$}0.001), permitting calibration of DOS/DCS indices. The results suggest that MRI and optics offer new tools to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism in CHD neonates.},

Measurement of blood oxygen saturation (HbO2) and flow in the major cerebral outflow and inflow vessels can provide a global estimate of CMRO2. We demonstrate a rapid noninvasive method for quantifying CMRO2 by simultaneously measuring venous oxygen saturation in the superior sagittal sinus with magnetic resonance susceptometry-based oximetry, a technique that exploits the intrinsic susceptibility of deoxygenated hemoglobin, and the average blood inflow rate with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging.

The T1 of the renal cortex decreased significantly when breathing pure oxygen as compared to normoxia (from 882 {$\pm$} 59 to 829 {$\pm$} 70 msec, P {$<$} 0.05), while that of the renal medulla was unchanged. No significant changes were seen in the T\,*2 of either compartment. Dynamic imaging using an inversion recovery sequence with an optimized inversion time typically produced signal changes of 20\% in the renal cortex. Studies to assess if oxygen-induced changes in flow contributed to this effect showed that the flow contribution was not significant. Although longer inversion times (880 ms) produced optimal contrast, acceptable contrast was also obtained at shorter inversion times (450 msec) in the renal cortex, spleen, and lung, with the latter being of opposite polarity to the other two tissues, implying a shorter parenchymal T1 than previously reported in the literature. The results are consistent with oxygen acting as an intravascular contrast agent which induces a shortening of T1 in the arterial blood volume.

Second, to compare MRI measurements of Vc using the semiautomatic segmentation method with a manual segmentation method. Third, to evaluate the reproducibility of Vc measurements. Materials and Methods A total of 22 pigs, 13 with healthy kidneys and nine with diseased kidneys, underwent MRI with two non-contrast-agent methods (MRI100\texttimes{}900 and MRI300\texttimes{}1100) and one contrast-agent method (MRIGd). For each of these methods, Vc was estimated using semiautomatic (Vc100\texttimes{}900, Vc300\texttimes{}1100, and VcGd), as well as manual (VcMANUAL) segmentation. Reference volumes were estimated by stereological means (VcSTEREOLOGY). MRI-derived volumes were compared with reference volumes using a two-tailed paired t-test, and variances between methods were visualized with Bland Altman plots. Reproducibilities were analyzed using covariance analysis. Results Neither measurements of Vc100\texttimes{}900, Vc300\texttimes{}1100, nor VcGd differed markedly from VcSTEREOLOGY using semiautomatic segmentation.

  abstract = {Purpose
To demonstrate the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of kidneys with respiratory triggering, and determine the optimal imaging parameters for fraction anisotropy (FA) maps.
Materials and Methods
DTI of kidneys from 16 healthy volunteers was performed using a 1.5T scanner. Five different sequences with different parameters including respiration-triggered acquisition or multiple breath-holding, slice thicknesses of 3 or 5 mm, and different numbers of signal averaging and b values were compared. FA and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of the cortex and medulla were measured. Measurement error within the same and repeated examination was examined using within-individual standard deviation (Sw).
Results
FAs of the renal cortex were lower than the medulla (mean value of a sequence ranging 0.148\textendash{}0.224, 0.433\textendash{}0.476) and the ADCs of the cortex were higher than the medulla (2.26\textendash{}2.69 \texttimes{} 10-3 mm2/s, 1.77\textendash{}2.19 \texttimes{} 10-3 mm2/s) in all sequences (P {$<$} 0.001). The renal cortex\textendash{}medulla difference was the largest, with respiratory trigger- ing including a 3-mm slice thickness, three signal averages,and a b-value = 0, 200, or 400 s/mm2 (P {$<$} 0.001). Sw tended to be smaller in the sequence with a b-value of 400 s/mm2.

DTI of kidneys with respiratory triggering is feasible with excellent cortex\textendash{}medulla differentiation. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2009;29:736\textendash{}744. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The data consisted of T2 weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and pre- and post-contrast T2 and T2* maps. Following each scan, the tumors were excised into 2\textendash{}3-mm thin slices parallel to the axial field of view and processed for histological staining. The MRI data were segmented using SRSC, K-means, fuzzy C-means, and Gaussian mixture modeling to estimate the fractional population of necrotic, peri-necrotic, and viable regions and validated with the fractional population obtained from histology.ResultsWhile the aforementioned methods overestimated peri-necrotic and underestimated viable fractions, SRSC accurately predicted the fractional population of all three tumor tissue types and exhibited strong correlations (rnecrotic = 0.92, rperi-necrotic = 0.82 and rviable = 0.98) with the histology.ConclusionsThe precise identification of necrotic, peri-necrotic and viable areas using SRSC may greatly assist in cancer treatment planning and add a new dimension to MRI-guided tumor biopsy procedures.},

  abstract = {Object Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain tumor is heterogeneous in nature, so its quantification depends on how to accurately segment different parts of the tumor, i.e. viable tumor, edema and necrosis. This procedure becomes more effective when metabolic and functional information, provided by physiological magnetic resonance (MR) imaging modalities, like diffusion-weighted-imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted-imaging (PWI), is incorporated with the anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this preliminary tumor quantification work, the idea is to characterize different regions of GBM tumors in an MRI-based semi-automatic multi-parametric approach to achieve more accurate characterization of pathogenic regions.Materials and methods For this purpose, three MR sequences, namely T2-weighted imaging (anatomical MR imaging), PWI and DWI of thirteen GBM patients, were acquired. To enhance the delineation of the boundaries of each pathogenic region (peri-tumoral edema, viable tumor and necrosis), the spatial fuzzy C-means algorithm is combined with the region growing method.ResultsThe results show that exploiting the multi-parametric approach along with the proposed semi-automatic segmentation method can differentiate various tumorous regions with over 80 \% sensitivity, specificity and dice score.ConclusionThe proposed MRI-based multi-parametric segmentation approach has the potential to accurately segment tumorous regions, leading to an efficient design of the pre-surgical treatment planning.},

  abstract = {Purpose

Determine the reproducibility of renal artery blood flow (RABF) and blood-oxygenation level dependent (R2*) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and healthy controls.

Materials and Methods

RABF and R2* were measured in 11 CKD patients and 9 controls twice with 1- to 2-week interval. R2* in the cortex and medulla were determined after breathing atmospheric air and 100\% oxygen. Reproducibility was evaluated by coefficients of variation (CV), limits of agreements and intra-class coefficient calculated by variance components by maximum likelihood modeling.

Results

Single-kidney RABF (mL/min) for patients was: 170 {$\pm$} 130 and 186 {$\pm$} 137, and for controls: 365 {$\pm$} 119 and 361 {$\pm$} 107 (P {$<$} 0.05 versus patients), for first and second scans, respectively. RABF measurements were reproducible with a CV of 12.9\% and 8.3\% for patients and controls, respectively. Renal cortical R2* was: 13.6 {$\pm$} 0.9 and 13.5 {$\pm$} 1.2 in patients (CV = 8.0\%), and 13.8 {$\pm$} 1.6 and 14.0 {$\pm$} 1.5 in controls (CV = 5.6\%), while medullary R2*(s-1) was: 26.9 {$\pm$} 2.0 and 27.0 {$\pm$} 4.0 (CV = 8.0\%) in patients, and 26.0 {$\pm$} 2.4 and 26.1 {$\pm$} 2.1 (CV = 3.6\%) in controls, for first and second scans, respectively. In both groups R2* in medulla decreased after breathing 100\% oxygen.

Conclusion

The reproducibility was high for both RABF and R2* in patients and controls, particularly in the cortex. Inhalation of 100\% oxygen reduced medullary R2*. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;40:1091\textendash{}1098. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Two inversion recovery (IR) images are acquired by interleaving slice-selective inversion and nonselective inversion. During the inversion delay time after slice-selective inversion, fully magnetized blood spins move into the imaging slice and exchange with tissue water. The signal enhancement (FAIR image) measured by the signal difference between two images is directly related to blood flow. For functional MR imaging studies, two IR images are alternatively and repeatedly acquired during control and task periods. Relative signal changes in the FAIR images during the task periods represent the relative regional cerebral blood flow changes. The FAIR technique has been successfully applied to functional brain mapping studies in humans during finger opposition movements.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several studies have attempted to characterize intracranial atherosclerotic plaques by using MR imaging sequences. However, dedicated validation of these sequences with histology has not yet been performed. The current study assessed the ability of ultra-high-resolution 7T MR imaging sequences with different image contrast weightings to image plaque components, by using histology as criterion standard.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five specimens of the circle of Wills were imaged at 7T with 0.11 \texttimes{} 0.11 mm in-plane-resolution proton attenuation\textendash, T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted sequences (through-plane resolution, 0.11\textendash{}1 mm). Tissue samples from 13 fiducial-marked locations (per specimen) on MR imaging underwent histologic processing and atherosclerotic plaque classification. Reconstructed MR images were matched with histologic sections at corresponding locations.
RESULTS: Forty-four samples were available for subsequent evaluation of agreement or disagreement between plaque components and image contrast differences. Of samples, 52.3\% (n = 23) showed no image contrast heterogeneity; this group comprised solely no lesions or early lesions. Of samples, 25.0\% (n = 11, mostly advanced lesions) showed good correlation between the spatial organization of MR imaging heterogeneities and plaque components. Areas of foamy macrophages were generally seen as proton attenuation\textendash, T2-, and T2*- hypointense areas, while areas of increased collagen content showed more ambiguous signal intensities. Five samples showed image-contrast heterogeneity without corresponding plaque components on histology; 5 other samples showed contrast heterogeneity based on intima-media artifacts.
CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging at 7T has the image contrast capable of identifying both focal intracranial vessel wall thickening and distinguishing areas of different signal intensities spatially corresponding to plaque components within more advanced atherosclerotic plaques.},

  abstract = {An accurate noninvasive method to measure the hemoglobin oxygen saturation (\%HbO2) of deep-lying vessels without catheterization would have many clinical applications. Quantitative MRI may be the only imaging modality that can address this difficult and important problem. MR susceptometry\textendash{}based oximetry for measuring blood oxygen saturation in large vessels models the vessel as a long paramagnetic cylinder immersed in an external field. The intravascular magnetic susceptibility relative to surrounding muscle tissue is a function of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and can be quantified with a field-mapping pulse sequence. In this work, the method's accuracy and precision was investigated theoretically on the basis of an analytical expression for the arbitrarily oriented cylinder, as well as experimentally in phantoms and in vivo in the femoral artery and vein at 3T field strength. Errors resulting from vessel tilt, noncircularity of vessel cross-section, and induced magnetic field gradients were evaluated and methods for correction were designed and implemented. Hemoglobin saturation was measured at successive vessel segments, differing in geometry, such as eccentricity and vessel tilt, but constant blood oxygen saturation levels, as a means to evaluate measurement consistency. The average standard error and coefficient of variation of measurements in phantoms were {$<$}2\% with tilt correction alone, in agreement with theory, suggesting that high accuracy and reproducibility can be achieved while ignoring noncircularity for tilt angles up to about 30\textdegree. In vivo, repeated measurements of \%HbO2 in the femoral vessels yielded a coefficient of variation of less than 5\%. In conclusion, the data suggest that \%HbO2 can be measured reproducibly in vivo in large vessels of the peripheral circulation on the basis of the paramagnetic cylinder approximation of the incremental field.

  abstract = {The kidneys account for about 10\% of the whole body oxygen consumption, whereas only 0.5\% of the total body mass. It is known that intrarenal hypoxia is present in several diseases associated with development of kidney disease, including diabetes, and when renal blood flow is unaffected. The importance of deranged oxygen metabolism is further supported by deterioration of kidney function in patients with diabetes living at high altitude. Thus, we argue that reduced oxygen availability alters renal energy metabolism. Here, we introduce a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach to monitor metabolic changes associated with diabetes and oxygen availability. Streptozotocin diabetic and control rats were given reduced, normal, or increased inspired oxygen in order to alter tissue oxygenation. The effects on kidney oxygen metabolism were studied using hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate MRI. Reduced inspired oxygen did not alter renal metabolism in the control group. Reduced oxygen availability in the diabetic kidney altered energy metabolism by increasing lactate and alanine formation by 23\% and 34\%, respectively, whereas the bicarbonate flux was unchanged. Thus, the increased prevalence and severity of nephropathy in patients with diabetes at high altitudes may originate from the increased sensitivity toward inspired oxygen. This increased lactate production shifts the metabolic routs toward hypoxic pathways.},

  abstract = {The global cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), which reflects metabolic activity of the brain under various physiologic conditions, can be quantified using a method, referred to as `OxFlow', which simultaneously measures hemoglobin oxygen saturation in a draining vein (Yv) and total cerebral blood flow (tCBF). Conventional OxFlow (Conv-OxFlow) entails four interleaves incorporated in a single pulse sequence \textendash{} two for phase-contrast based measurement of tCBF in the supplying arteries of the neck, and two to measure the intra- to extravascular phase difference in the superior sagittal sinus to derive Yv [Jain et al., JCBFM 2010]. However, this approach limits achievable temporal resolution thus precluding capture of rapid changes of brain metabolic states such as the response to apneic stimuli. Here, we developed a time-efficient, multiplexed OxFlow method and evaluated its potential for measuring dynamic alterations in global CMRO2 during a breath-hold challenge. Two different implementations of multiplexed OxFlow were investigated: 1) simultaneous-echo-refocusing based OxFlow (SER-OxFlow) and 2) simultaneous-multi-slice imaging-based dual-band OxFlow (DB-OxFlow). The two sequences were implemented on 3 T scanners (Siemens TIM Trio and Prisma) and their performance was evaluated in comparison to Conv-OxFlow in ten healthy subjects for baseline CMRO2 quantification. Comparison of measured parameters (Yv, tCBF, CMRO2) revealed no significant bias of SER-OxFlow and DB-OxFlow, with respect to the reference Conv-OxFlow while improving temporal resolution two-fold (12.5 versus 25 s). Further acceleration shortened scan time to 8 and 6 s for SER and DB-OxFlow, respectively, for time-resolved CMRO2 measurement. The two sequences were able of capturing smooth transitions of Yv, tCBF, and CMRO2 over the time course consisting of 30 s of normal breathing, 30 s of volitional apnea, and 90 s of recovery. While both SER- and DB-OxFlow techniques provide significantly improved temporal resolution (by a factor of 3 \textendash{} 4 relative to Conv-OxFlow), DB-OxFlow was found to be superior for the study of short physiologic stimuli.},

The authors compared CBF imaging using flow sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR)-MRI and 14C-Iodoantipyrine (IAP)-autoradiography in a mouse model of acute stroke. Twenty-nine male 129S6/SvEv mice were subjected to filamentous left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). CBF imaging was performed with 14C-IAP autoradiography and FAIR-MRI using two different anesthesia protocols, namely intravenous infusion of etomidate or inhalation of isoflurane, which differentially affect perfusion. Using 14C-IAP autoradiography, the average CBF in ml/(100~g⁎min) was 160{$\pm$}34 (isoflurane, n=5) vs. and 59{$\pm$}21 (etomidate, n=7) in the intact hemisphere and 43{$\pm$}12 (isoflurane, n=5) vs. 36{$\pm$}12 (etomidate, n=7) in the MCAo hemisphere. Using FAIR-MRI, the corresponding average CBFs were 208{$\pm$}56 (isoflurane, intact hemisphere, n=7), 84{$\pm$}9 (etomidate, intact hemisphere, n=7), 72{$\pm$}22 (isoflurane, MCAo hemisphere, n=7) and 48{$\pm$}13 (etomidate, MCAo hemisphere, n=7). Regression analysis showed a strong linear correlation between CBF measured with FAIR-MRI and 14C-IAP autoradiography, and FAIR-MRI overestimated CBF compared to autoradiography.

  abstract = {Susceptometry-based MR oximetry has previously been shown suitable for quantifying hemoglobin oxygen saturation in large vessels for studying vascular reactivity and quantification of global cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization. A key assumption underlying this method is that large vessels can be modeled as long paramagnetic cylinders. However, bifurcations, tapering, noncircular cross-section, and curvature of these vessels produce substantial deviations from cylindrical geometry, which may lead to errors in hemoglobin oxygen saturation quantification. Here, the accuracy of the ``long cylinder'' approximation is evaluated via numerical computation of the induced magnetic field from 3D segmented renditions of three veins of interest (superior sagittal sinus, femoral and jugular vein). At a typical venous oxygen saturation of 65\%, the absolute error in hemoglobin oxygen saturation estimated via a closed-form cylinder approximation was 2.6\% hemoglobin oxygen saturation averaged over three locations in the three veins studied and did not exceed 5\% for vessel tilt angles {$<$}30\textdegree{} at any one location. In conclusion, the simulation results provide a significant level of confidence for the validity of the cylinder approximation underlying MR susceptometry-based oximetry of large vessels.

  abstract = {Objective:
Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an important technique for the localization of prostate cancer, and its response assessment during treatment with radiotherapy (RT). However, it has known limitations in terms of distortions and artefacts using standard acquisition techniques. This study evaluates two alternative methods that offer the promise of improved image quality and the potential for more reliable and consistent diffusion data.

Methods:
Three DWI techniques were investigated; single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI), EPI combined with reduced volume excitation (ZOOMit; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and read-out segmentation with navigator-echo correction (RESOLVE; Siemens Healthcare). Daily measurements of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value were made in a quality assurance phantom to assess the repeatability of each sequence. In order to evaluate the geometric integrity of these sequences, ten normal volunteers were scanned, and the prostate was contoured to compare its similarity with T2 weighted images.

Results:
Phantom ADC values were significantly higher using the standard EPI sequence than those of the other two sequences. Differences were also observed between sequences in terms of repeatability, with RESOLVE and EPI performing better than ZOOMit. Overall, the RESOLVE sequence provided the best agreement for the in vivo data with smaller differences in volume and higher contour similarity than T2 weighted imaging.

Conclusion:
Important differences have been observed between each of the three techniques investigated with RESOLVE performing the best overall. We have adopted this sequence for routine RT simulation of prostate patients at Liverpool Cancer Therapy Centre.

Advances in knowledge:
This work will be of interest to the increasing number of centres wanting to incorporate quantitative DWI in a clinical setting.},

Venous oxygenation (Yv) is an important index of brain physiology and may be indicative of brain diseases. A T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) MRI technique was recently developed to measure Yv. A multi-site evaluation of this technique would be an important step toward broader availability and potential clinical utilizations of Yv measures.

Methods
TRUST MRI was performed on a total of 250 healthy subjects, with 125 from the developer's site and 25 each from five other sites. All sites were equipped with a 3T MRI of the same vendor. The estimated Yv and the standard error of the estimation, {$\epsilon$}Yv, were compared across sites.

Results
The averaged Yv and {$\epsilon$}Yv across six sites were 61.1{$\pm$}1.4\% and 1.3{$\pm$}0.2\%, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the estimated Yv was dependent on age (p=0.009), but not on performance site. In contrast, the standard error of Yv estimation was site-dependent (p=0.024), but was all less than 1.5\%. Further analysis revealed that {$\epsilon$}Yv was positively associated with the amount of subject motion (p{$<$}0.001) but negatively associated with blood signal intensity (p{$<$}0.001).

Conclusion
This work suggests that TRUST MRI can yield equivalent results of Yv estimation across different sites.},

Variants of DWI include intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), which differentiates between microstructural diffusion and vascular or tubular flow, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which quantifies diffusion directionality. Purpose To investigate the reproducibility of joint IVIM-DTI and compare controls to presurgical renal mass patients. Study Type Prospective cross-sectional. Subjects Thirteen healthy controls and ten presurgical renal mass patients were scanned. Ten controls were scanned twice to investigate reproducibility. Field Strength/Sequence Subjects were scanned on a 3T system using 10 b-values and 20 diffusion directions for IVIM-DTI in a study approved by the local Institutional Review Board. Assessment Retrospective coregistration and measurement of joint IVIM-DTI parameters were performed. Statistical Analysis Parameter reproducibility was defined as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) {$>$}0.7 and coefficient of variation (CV) {$<$}30\%. Patient data were stratified by lesion side (contralateral/ipsilateral) for comparison with controls. Corticomedullary differentiation was evaluated. Results In controls, the reproducible subset of REnal Flow and Microstructure AnisotroPy (REFMAP) parameters had average ICC = 0.82 and CV = 7.5\%. In renal mass patients, medullary fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly lower than in controls (0.227 {$\pm$} 0.072 vs. 0.291 {$\pm$} 0.044, P = 0.016 for the kidney contralateral to the mass and 0.228 {$\pm$} 0.070 vs. 0.291 {$\pm$} 0.044, P = 0.018 for the kidney ipsilateral). In the kidney ipsilateral to the mass, cortical Dp,radial was significantly higher than in controls (P = 0.012). Conversely, medullary Dp,axial was significantly lower in contralateral than ipsilateral kidneys (P = 0.027) and normal controls (P = 0.044). Data Conclusion REFMAP-MRI parameters provide unique information regarding renal dysfunction. In presurgical renal mass patients, directional flow changes were noted that were not identified with IVIM analysis alone. Both contralateral and ipsilateral kidneys in patients show reductions in structural diffusivities and anisotropy, while flow metrics showed opposing changes in contralateral vs. ipsilateral kidneys.

METHODS: Using freshly collected blood samples from human umbilical cord, we performed in vitro experiments under controlled physiological conditions to measure blood T1 and T2 at 3 Tesla (T) and their dependence on several factors, including hematocrit (Hct), oxygenation (Y) and temperature.
RESULTS: The arterial T1 in neonates was 1825{$\pm$}184 ms (Hct=0.42{$\pm$}0.08), longer than that of adult blood. Neonatal blood T1 was strongly dependent on Hct (P{$<$}0.001) and Y (P=0.005), and the dependence of T1 on Y was more prominent at higher Hct. The arterial T2 of neonatal blood was 191 ms at an Hct of 0.42, which was also longer than adult blood. Neonatal blood T2 was positively associated with blood oxygenation and negatively associated with hematocrit level, and can be characterized by an exchange model. Neonatal blood T1 was also positively associated with temperature (P{$<$}0.001).
CONCLUSION: The values provided in this report may provide important reference and calibration information for sequence optimization and quantification of in vivo neonatal MRI studies.},

This study sought to establish a standard acquisition procedure for this technique and to evaluate its test\textendash{}retest reproducibility in healthy subjects. Each subject was examined in five sessions and each session included two measurements. Intrasession, intersession, and intersubject coefficients of variation for CMRO2 were found to be 3.84 {$\pm$} 1.44\% (N = 7, mean {$\pm$} standard deviation), 6.59 {$\pm$} 1.56\%, and 8.80\% respectively. These reproducibility values were comparable or slightly superior to 15O positron emission tomography (PET) results reported in the literature. It was also found that oxygen-extraction-fraction and cerebral-blood-flow tended to co-vary across sessions (P = 0.002) and subjects (P = 0.01), and their coefficients of variation were greater than that of CMRO2. The simplicity and reliability features may afford this global CMRO2 technique great potential for immediate clinical applications.

  abstract = {PurposeSegmentation of the liver from abdominal computed tomography (CT) images is an essential step in some computer-assisted clinical interventions, such as surgery planning for living donor liver transplant, radiotherapy and volume measurement. In this work, we develop a deep learning algorithm with graph cut refinement to automatically segment the liver in CT scans.MethodsThe proposed method consists of two main steps: (i) simultaneously liver detection and probabilistic segmentation using 3D convolutional neural network; (ii) accuracy refinement of the initial segmentation with graph cut and the previously learned probability map.ResultsThe proposed approach was validated on forty CT volumes taken from two public databases MICCAI-Sliver07 and 3Dircadb1. For the MICCAI-Sliver07 test dataset, the calculated mean ratios of volumetric overlap error (VOE), relative volume difference (RVD), average symmetric surface distance (ASD), root-mean-square symmetric surface distance (RMSD) and maximum symmetric surface distance (MSD) are 5.9, 2.7 \%, 0.91, 1.88 and 18.94 mm, respectively. For the 3Dircadb1 dataset, the calculated mean ratios of VOE, RVD, ASD, RMSD and MSD are 9.36, 0.97 \%, 1.89, 4.15 and 33.14 mm, respectively.ConclusionsThe proposed method is fully automatic without any user interaction. Quantitative results reveal that the proposed approach is efficient and accurate for hepatic volume estimation in a clinical setup. The high correlation between the automatic and manual references shows that the proposed method can be good enough to replace the time-consuming and nonreproducible manual segmentation method.},

This technique has shown promise for normalization of fMRI signals, for the assessment of oxygen metabolism, and in studies of cognitive aging and multiple sclerosis. However, a human validation study has not been conducted. In addition, the calibration curve used to convert blood T2 to Y has not accounted for the effects of hematocrit (Hct). In this study, we first conducted experiments on blood samples under physiologic conditions, and the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill T2 was determined for a range of Y and Hct values. The data were fitted to a two-compartment exchange model to allow the characterization of a three-dimensional plot that can serve to calibrate the in vivo data. Next, in a validation study in humans, we showed that arterial Y estimated using TRUST MRI was 0.837 {$\pm$} 0.036 (N=7) during the inhalation of 14\% O2, which was in excellent agreement with the gold-standard Y values of 0.840 {$\pm$} 0.036 based on Pulse-Oximetry. These data suggest that the availability of this calibration plot should enhance the applicability of T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging MRI for noninvasive assessment of cerebral blood oxygenation.

In this study a novel technique, T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI, is developed to estimate oxygenation in venous vessels. This method uses the spin labeling principle to automatically isolate pure blood signals from which T2 relaxation times are determined using flow-insensitive T2-preparation pulses. The blood T2 is then converted to blood oxygenation using a calibration plot. In vivo experiments gave a baseline venous oxygenation of 64.8 {$\pm$} 6.3\% in sagittal sinus in healthy volunteers (n = 24). Reproducibility studies demonstrated that the standard deviation across trials was 2.0 {$\pm$} 1.1\%. The effects of repetition time and inversion time selections were investigated. The TRUST technique was further tested using various physiologic challenges. Hypercapnia induced an increase in venous oxygenation by 13.8 {$\pm$} 1.1\%. On the other hand, caffeine ingestion resulted in a decrease in oxygenation by 7.0 {$\pm$} 1.8\%. Contrast agent infusion (Gd-DTPA, 0.1 mmol/kg) reduced venous blood T2 by 11.2 ms.

Our label query strategy is inspired from the principles of visual saliency that have similar considerations for choosing the most salient region. These similarities are encoded in a graph using classification maps and low-level features. Random walks are used to identify the most informative node, which is equivalent to the label query sample in AL. To reduce computation time, a volume of interest (VOI) is identified and all subsequent analysis, such as probability map generation using semisupervised random forest classifiers and label query, is restricted to this VOI. The negative log-likelihood of the probability maps serves as the penalty cost in a second-order Markov random field cost function, which is optimized using graph cuts for prostate segmentation. Experimental results on the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2012 prostate segmentation challenge show the superior performance of our approach to conventional methods using fully supervised learning.},

  abstract = {In principle, multiple-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to estimate the spin-spin relaxation time, T2, which can then be used for quantitative tissue characterization. Although multiple echoes can be used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in an image, by echo addition, rf pulse imperfections modify the echo amplitudes resulting in significant errors in the estimate of T2. Imperfect 180\textdegree{} pulses do not completely invert the transverse magnetization so that the magnitude of the transverse component is reduced and a longitudinal component is generated. Successive application of such imperfect pulses generates many components that interact in a complex manner. The amplitudes of successive echoes are affected whenever the transverse components refocus, whereas the longitudinal components may be rotated into the transverse plane by subsequent pulses and may often add to the image signal or give rise to an image artifact. These effects have been analyzed theoretically and have been demonstrated for a wide range of rf pulse imperfections using both simple and composite pulses, through computer simulations based on the numerical solution of the Bloch equations. The theoretical and simulation results have been substantiated through experiments performed on a mineral oil phantom using a resistive prototype MR scanner operating at 6.35 MHz. In this paper we report the effects of improper pulse amplitude or duration for nonselective rf pulses on resonance. We separately describe the other types of imperfections caused by off-resonance effects and the use of selective pulses. \textcopyright{} 1986 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Most arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques apply echoplanar imaging (EPI) because this strategy provides relatively high SNR in short measuring times. Unfortunately, those techniques are very susceptible to static magnetic field inhomogeneities and perfusion signals from organs with fast transverse relaxation might decrease due to the exchange of water molecules in capillaries and organ tissue combined with relatively long echo times of EPI sequences. To overcome these problems a novel imaging technique, FAIR True-FISP, was developed. It combines a FAIR (flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery) perfusion preparation and a true fast imaging with steady precession (True-FISP) data acquisition strategy. True-FISP was chosen since this sequence type does not show the mentioned disadvantages of EPI, but provides a similar SNR per measuring time. An important problem of this approach is that True-FISP sequences usually work in a steady state which is independent of a previous preparation of magnetization. For this reason a sequence structure had to be developed which keeps the advantages of True-FISP and makes the signal intensity sensitive to the FAIR preparation. Breathhold and nonbreathhold examinations of kidneys are presented and possible strategies to quantitative flow measurements are reported. It is shown that correction of spatially inhomogeneous receiver coil characteristics is easily feasible and leads to clinically valuable perfusion examinations of kidneys without application of potentially nephrotoxic contrast media.

The potential of ASL for perfusion imaging was tested in several types of tissue.MethodsAfter a systematic comparison of technical aspects of continuous and pulsed ASL techniques the standard kinetic model and tissue properties of influence to quantitative measurements of perfusion are reported. For the applications demonstrated in this paper a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) ASL perfusion preparation approach followed by true fast imaging with steady precession (true FISP) data recording was developed and implemented on whole-body scanners operating at 0.2, 1.5 and 3 T for quantitative perfusion measurement in various types of tissue.ResultsASL imaging provides a non-invasive tool for assessment of tissue perfusion rates in vivo. Images recorded from kidney, lung, brain, salivary gland and thyroid gland provide a spatial resolution of a few millimetres and sufficient signal to noise ratio in perfusion maps after 2\textendash{}5 min of examination time.ConclusionsNewly developed ASL techniques provide especially high image quality and quantitative perfusion maps in tissues with relatively high perfusion rates (as also present in many tumours). Averaging of acquisitions and image subtraction procedures are mandatory, leading to the necessity of synchronization of data recording to breathing in abdominal and thoracic organs.},

In many cases, however, maps from multiple modalities may be required for more complete tumor mapping. In this manuscript we propose an objective method for combining multiple imaging datasets with the goal of characterizing malignant tumors. We refer to the proposed technique as the percent overlap method (POM). To demonstrate the power and flexibility of the POM analysis, we present four patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Each patient had multiple magnetic resonance imaging procedures resulting in seven different parameter maps. Chemical shift imaging was used to provide three metabolite ratio maps (Cho:NAA, Cho:Cre, Lac:Cre). A perfusion scan provided regional cerebral blood volume and permeability maps. Diffusion and carbogen-based hypoxia mapping data were also acquired. Composite maps were formed for each patient using POM, then were compared to results from the ISODATA clustering technique. The POM maps of likely recurrent tumor regions were found to be consistent with the ISODATA clustering method. This manuscript presents an objective method for combining parameters from multiple physiologic imaging techniques into a single composite map. The accuracy of the map depends strongly on the sensitivity of the chosen imaging parameters to the disease process at the time of image acquisition. Further validation of this method may be achieved by correlation with histological data.},

It was found that altitude is the most important factor affecting the reference value of the hematocrit. As the altitude gradually increases, the reference value of the hematocrit also increases. The relationship is quite significant. By using the method of stepwise regression analysis, two multivariate regression equations were deduced: Y\textasciicircum{}1 = 39.7 + 0.00328X1 + 0.00169X2 + 0.00117X5 {$\pm$} 2.3, Y\textasciicircum{}2 = 38.8 + 0.00275X1 + 0.000578X2 \textendash{}0.00298X4 {$\pm$} 2.2 In these equations, Y\textasciicircum{}1 is the reference value of presenile men's hematocrit (\%); Y\textasciicircum{}2 is the reference value of presenile women's hematocrit (\%); X1 is altitude (m); X2 is the average annual hours of sunshine (h); X4 is the average annual temperature (\textdegree{}C), and X5 is the average annual precipitation (mm). If the geographical index values in a particular area in China are known, the reference value of presenile human hematocrit in this area can be calculated approximately by means of the regression equations.

While there is a relatively mature literature on post mortem diffusion imaging of animals, human brains have proven more challenging due to their incompatibility with high-performance scanners. This study presents a method for post mortem diffusion imaging of whole, human brains using a clinical 3-Tesla scanner with a 3D segmented EPI spin-echo sequence. Results in eleven brains at 0.94\texttimes{}0.94\texttimes{}0.94mm resolution are presented, and in a single brain at 0.73\texttimes{}0.73\texttimes{}0.73mm resolution. Region-of-interest analysis of diffusion tensor parameters indicate that these properties are altered compared to in vivo (reduced diffusivity and anisotropy), with significant dependence on post mortem interval (time from death to fixation). Despite these alterations, diffusion tractography of several major tracts is successfully demonstrated at both resolutions. We also report novel findings of cortical anisotropy and partial volume effects.},

Traditional teaching on neuroimaging usually consists of a series of lectures that emphasize the big picture rather than the foundations on which the techniques are based. The lectures are often paired with practical workshops in which students run imaging analyses using the graphical interface of specific neuroimaging software packages. Our experience suggests that this combination leaves the student with a superficial understanding of the underlying ideas, and an informal, inefficient, and inaccurate approach to analysis. To address these problems, we based our course around a substantial open-ended group project. This allowed us to teach: (a) computational tools to ensure computationally reproducible work, such as the Unix command line, structured code, version control, automated testing, and code review and (b) a clear understanding of the statistical techniques used for a basic analysis of a single run in an MRI scanner. The emphasis we put on the group project showed the importance of standard computational tools for accuracy, efficiency, and collaboration. The projects were broadly successful in engaging students in working reproducibly on real scientific questions. We propose that a course on this model should be the foundation for future programs in neuroimaging. We believe it will also serve as a model for teaching efficient and reproducible research in other fields of computational science.},

  abstract = {Summary
Neuronal cortical circuitry comprises feedforward, lateral, and feedback projections, each of which terminates in distinct cortical layers [1, 2, 3]. In sensory systems, feedforward processing transmits signals from the external world into the cortex, whereas feedback pathways signal the brain's inference of the world [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, the integration of feedforward, lateral, and feedback inputs within each cortical area impedes the investigation of feedback, and to date, no technique has isolated the feedback of visual scene information in distinct layers of healthy human cortex. We masked feedforward input to a region of V1 cortex and studied the remaining internal processing. Using high-resolution functional brain imaging (0.8~mm3) and multivoxel pattern information techniques, we demonstrate that during normal visual stimulation scene information peaks in mid-layers. Conversely, we found that contextual feedback information peaks in outer, superficial layers. Further, we found that shifting the position of the visual scene surrounding the mask parametrically modulates feedback in superficial layers of V1. Our results reveal the layered cortical organization of external versus internal visual processing streams during perception in healthy human subjects. We provide empirical support for theoretical feedback models such as predictive coding [10, 12] and coherent infomax [13] and reveal the potential of high-resolution fMRI to access internal processing in sub-millimeter human cortex.},

Patients were divided into two groups regarding body weight: below (n=29) and above 10 kg (n=31). Linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient were calculated. Bland-Altman analysis, sensitivity, and specificity calculation for spatially resolved near-infrared spectroscopy with a cutoff level of 60\% were performed. Simultaneously measured values for SjO2 (67.3{$\pm$}9.8\%, 40\textendash{}84.1\%) and TOI (65.7{$\pm$}7.2\%, 39\textendash{}80\%) showed a significant correlation; the correlation in children weighing under 10 kg was stronger in children weighing over 10 kg. Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean bias of -1.8\% with limits of agreement between 11.7\% and -15.3\% for all children. Sensitivity and specificity of the SRS method were 46\% and 91\%, respectively, for all children and 53\% and 83\% respectively in infants weighing under 10 kg.ConclusionsThe results demonstrate that despite a significant correlation, sensitivity of spatially resolved spectroscopy is poor, and it is questionable whether TOI can be used reliably to detect low SjO2.},

Yet, in vivo assessment of renal haemodynamics and tissue oxygenation remains a challenge. Many of the established approaches are invasive, hence not applicable in humans. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers an alternative. BOLD-MRI is non-invasive and indicative of renal tissue oxygenation. Nonetheless, recent (pre-) clinical studies revived the question as to how bold renal BOLD-MRI really is. This review aimed to deliver some answers. It is designed to inspire the renal physiology, nephrology and imaging communities to foster explorations into the assessment of renal oxygenation and haemodynamics by exploiting the powers of MRI. For this purpose, the specifics of renal oxygenation and perfusion are outlined. The fundamentals of BOLD-MRI are summarized. The link between tissue oxygenation and the oxygenation-sensitive MR biomarker is outlined. The merits and limitations of renal BOLD-MRI in animal and human studies are surveyed together with their clinical implications. Explorations into detailing the relation between renal and renal tissue partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) are discussed with a focus on factors confounding the vs. tissue pO2 relation. Multi-modality in vivo approaches suitable for detailing the role of the confounding factors that govern are considered. A schematic approach describing the link between renal perfusion, oxygenation, tissue compartments and renal is proposed. Future directions of MRI assessment of renal oxygenation and perfusion are explored.},

We assessed fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) of various acquisition protocols and determined the reproducibility of these measurements. FA, ADC, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were compared with those acquired at 1.5T.
        Material and Methods:~Ten healthy volunteers were examined with a respiratory-triggered echo-planar imaging sequence (TR: 1800 ms, TE: 58 ms, b = 0, 300 s/mm2) on a 3-Tesla whole-body MR scanner. Protocol variations included diffusion measurements during free-breathing, in 6 or 12 directions, and an additional b-value of 50 s/mm2. A breath-hold protocol was also integrated (TR: 820 ms, TE: 58 ms, b = 0, 300 s/mm2). Measurements with 2 b-values and 6 diffusion directions were also acquired at 1.5 T. SNR was calculated with the difference-image method. Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Intrareader correlation was assessed with weighted kappa coefficients and reproducibility with the root-mean-square-average and the Bland-Altman-method.
        Results:~At 3T, SNR of cortex and medulla and CNR of cortex/medulla were significantly higher than at 1.5T, leading to improved corticomedullary discrimination. There were no significant FA- and ADC differences with 2 b-values and 6 diffusion directions between measurements at 1.5T and 3T. FA of the medulla was significantly higher than that of the cortex in all measurements. Tractography visualized a typical radial diffusion direction in the medulla. Best image quality was achieved with a respiratory triggered protocol with 12 acquisition directions. Measurements with 3 b-values led to decreased ADCs. Acquisition in 12 directions resulted in decreased cortical FA. FA and ADC of breath-hold and free-breathing acquisitions were significantly higher than that of the respiratory-triggered protocol. Intrareader correlation ranged from kappa 0.60 to 0.96. Variance of the respiratory-triggered protocol was smaller than that of breath-hold and free-breathing protocols. Variance was highest for medullary FA in all protocols with reproducibility coefficients ranging from 0.36 to 0.46.
        Conclusion:~Diffusion tensor imaging of the kidney at 3T is feasible and yields significantly higher SNR and CNR. FA and ADCs do not significantly differ from 1.5T. Number of b-values influences ADC-values. Acquisitions in 12 directions provide lower cortical FA-values. We recommend a respiratory-triggered protocol because of improved image quality and reproducibility.},

  abstract = {Carr\textendash{}Purcell\textendash{}Meiboom\textendash{}Gill-based sequences are often assumed to be insensitive to diffusion. However, imaging gradients always contribute some degree of diffusion weighting which increases with resolution. This may cause an apparent decrease in T2 when using a multi-echo sequence, such as quantitative T2 (qT2) at high resolution. This study investigated the impact of diffusion on the qT2 sequence. An equation was developed relating the diffusion factor associated with each echo (bqT2) to the underestimation of T2, which was strongly dependent on both the actual T2 and the apparent diffusion coefficient of the tissue. The diffusion dependence of the measured T2 was demonstrated in rat spinal cord. The measured T2 was independent of the imaging plane in gray matter, where diffusion was isotropic, and orientation dependent in white matter, where diffusion was strongly anisotropic. The dependence of the measured T2 on the actual T2 value was also demonstrated in MnCl2 phantoms. The relationship between the resolution and underestimation of T2 was investigated both theoretically and experimentally for the original readout and a fully refocused readout. The fully refocused readout increased the resolution at which diffusion effects could be neglected whilst measuring T2. To avoid the misidentification of cerebrospinal fluid when applying qT2 in the brain or spinal cord, a minimum in-plane voxel dimension of 0.2 mm was suggested for the standard qT2 sequence and 0.1 mm for the refocused readout. Simulations of myelin water fraction measurement indicated that signal-to-noise ratio requirements were increased in the presence of diffusion. Finally, the use of decreasing spoiler gradients to attenuate stimulated echoes should be avoided, as it was found to distort the T2 distribution when the slice thickness was less than 1 mm.

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging has shown promise for evaluating tissue oxygenation. In this study differences in the tissue longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) and effective transverse relaxation rate (R\,*2), induced by inhalation of pure oxygen and carbogen, were evaluated in 10 healthy subjects. Significant reductions in R1 were demonstrated following both oxygen and carbogen inhalation in the spleen (both P {$<$} 0.001), liver (P = 0.002 air vs. oxygen; P = 0.001 air vs. carbogen), skeletal muscle (both P {$<$} 0.001), and renal cortex (P = 0.005 air vs. oxygen; P = 0.008 air vs. carbogen). No significant change in R\,*2 occurred following pure oxygen in any organ. However, a significant increase in R\,*2 was observed in the spleen (P {$<$} 0.001), liver (P = 0.001), skeletal muscle (P = 0.026), and renal cortex (P = 0.001) following carbogen inhalation, an opposite effect to that observed in many studies of tumor pathophysiology. Changes in R1 and R\,*2 were independent of the gas administration order in the spleen and skeletal muscle. These findings suggest that the R1 and R\,*2 responses to hyperoxic gases are independent biomarkers of oxygen physiology.

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique that has attracted attention in recent years for applications such as nerve fiber tracking, neurography, and tumor detection. In DTI measurements, 2 motion-probing gradient (MPG) pulses are applied to evaluate water diffusion. In DTI for nerve fiber tracking, acquisition parameters, such as strength, duration, and separation of MPGs, influence the MR signal. In this study, we set acquisition parameters in DTI to emphasize fractional anisotropy to clarify the direction of nerve fibers. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of restricted diffusion in a cylinder model and phantom measurements with capillary plates to examine the relationship between the acquisition parameters in DTI and the size of restricted structures, particularly their diameter and length, which we will refer to as "compartment size." We confirmed that normalized signal intensities in DTI measurements depend on diffusion time, which, in turn, depends on the separation and duration of the MPG, and they decrease with increase in compartment size. Furthermore, our simulation and phantom results suggest that use of a longer diffusion time effectively emphasizes fractional anisotropy to clarify the direction of nerve fibers.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion imaging provides a valuable tool used for inferring structural anisotropy of brain white matter connectivity from diffusion tensor imaging. Recently, several high angular resolution diffusion models were introduced in order to overcome the inadequacy of the tensor model for describing fibre crossing within a single voxel. Among them, q-ball imaging (QBI), inherited from the q-space method, relies on a spherical Radon transform providing a direct relationship between the diffusion-weighted MR signal and the orientation distribution function (ODF). Experimental validation of these methods in a model system is necessary to determine the accuracy of the methods and to optimize them. A diffusion phantom made up of two textile rayon fibre (comparable in diameter to axons) bundles, crossing at 90\textdegree, was designed and dedicated to ex vivo q-ball validation on a clinical scanner. Normalized ODFs were calculated inside regions of interest corresponding to monomodal and bimodal configurations of underlying structures. Three-dimensional renderings of ODFs revealed monomodal shapes for voxels containing single-fibre population and bimodal patterns for voxels located within the crossing area. Principal orientations were estimated from ODFs and were compared with a priori structural fibre directions, validating efficiency of QBI for depicting fibre crossing. In the homogeneous regions, QBI detected the fibre angle with an accuracy of 19\textdegree{} and in the fibre-crossing region with an accuracy of 30\textdegree.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that functional MRI (fMRI) can be sensitive to the laminar and columnar organization of the cortex based on differences in the spatial and temporal characteristics of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal originating from the macrovasculature and the neuronal-specific microvasculature. Human fMRI studies at this scale of the cortical architecture, however, are very rare because the high spatial/temporal resolution required to explore these properties of the BOLD signal are limited by the signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we show that it is possible to detect BOLD signal changes at an isotropic spatial resolution as high as 0.55 mm at 7 T using a high-density multi-element surface coil with minimal electronics, which allows close proximity to the head. The coil comprises of very small, 1\,\texttimes\,2-cm2, elements arranged in four flexible modules of four elements each (16-channel) that can be positioned within 1 mm from the head. As a result of this proximity, tissue losses were five-fold greater than coil losses and sufficient to exclude preamplifier decoupling. When compared with a standard 16-channel head coil, the BOLD sensitivity was approximately 2.2-fold higher for a high spatial/temporal resolution (1 mm isotropic/0.4 s), multi-slice, echo planar acquisition, and approximately three- and six-fold higher for three-dimensional echo planar images acquired with isotropic resolutions of 0.7 and 0.55 mm, respectively. Improvements in parallel imaging performance (geometry factor) were up to around 1.5-fold with increasing acceleration factor, and improvements in fMRI detectability (temporal signal-to-noise ratio) were up to around four-fold depending on the distance to the coil. Although deeper lying structures may not benefit from the design, most fMRI questions pertain to the neocortex which lies within approximately 4 cm from the surface. These results suggest that the resolution of fMRI (at 7 T) can approximate levels that are closer to the spatial/temporal scale of the fundamental functional organization of the human cortex using a simple high-density coil design for high sensitivity.

  abstract = {Objectives
To assess inter-observer variability of renal blood oxygenation level-dependent MRI (BOLD-MRI) using a new method of analysis, called the concentric objects (CO) technique, in comparison with the classical ROI (region of interest)-based technique.
Methods
MR imaging (3T) was performed before and after furosemide in 10 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients (mean eGFR 43{$\pm$}24ml/min/1.73m2) and 10 healthy volunteers (eGFR 101{$\pm$}28ml/min1.73m2), and R2* maps were determined on four coronal slices. In the CO-technique, R2* values were based on a semi-automatic procedure that divided each kidney in six equal layers, whereas in the ROI-technique, all circles (ROIs) were placed manually in the cortex and medulla. The mean R2*values as assessed by two independent investigators were compared.
Results
With the CO-technique, inter-observer variability was 0.7\%\textendash{}1.9\% across all layers in non-CKD, versus 1.6\%\textendash{}3.8\% in CKD. With the ROI-technique, median variability for cortical and medullary R2* values was 3.6 and 6.8\% in non-CKD, versus 4.7 and 12.5\% in CKD; similar results were observed after furosemide.
Conclusion
The CO-technique offers a new, investigator-independent, highly reproducible alternative to the ROI-based technique to estimate renal tissue oxygenation in CKD.},

  abstract = {Single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) is well established as the method of choice for clinical, diffusion-weighted imaging with MRI because of its low sensitivity to the motion-induced phase errors that occur during diffusion sensitization of the MR signal. However, the method is prone to artifacts due to susceptibility changes at tissue interfaces and has a limited spatial resolution. The introduction of parallel imaging techniques, such as GRAPPA (GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions), has reduced these problems, but there are still significant limitations, particularly at higher field strengths, such as 3 Tesla (T), which are increasingly being used for routine clinical imaging. This study describes how the combination of readout-segmented EPI and parallel imaging can be used to address these issues by generating high-resolution, diffusion-weighted images at 1.5T and 3T with a significant reduction in susceptibility artifact compared with the single-shot case. The technique uses data from a 2D navigator acquisition to perform a nonlinear phase correction and to control the real-time reacquisition of unusable data that cannot be corrected. Measurements on healthy volunteers demonstrate that this approach provides a robust correction for motion-induced phase artifact and allows scan times that are suitable for routine clinical application.

  abstract = {Changes in renal medullary pO2 during water diuresis as evaluated by blood oxygenation level\textendash{}dependent magnetic resonance imaging: Effects of aging and cyclooxygenase inhibition. Background. Hypoxia of the renal medulla has been implicated in the development of renal injury, particularly acute renal failure, and its regulation in humans may therefore be relevant to certain renal disorders. Changes in oxygenation of the renal medulla can now be monitored noninvasively with blood oxygenation level\textendash{}dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using this method, water diuresis has been shown to improve medullary oxygenation in young persons. Urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) likewise increases during water diuresis in younger but not in older people. We used BOLD MRI to measure the effects of aging and of inhibiting prostaglandin synthetase on the renal response to water diuresis in healthy human subjects. Methods. Nine younger (25 to 31 years) and nine older (59 to 79 years) female volunteers were studied with BOLD MRI during antidiuresis in the postabsorptive state and during water diuresis. Simultaneously, urinary excretion of PGE2 was determined. PG synthetase was inhibited by administering ibuprofen. Results. Renal medullary oxygenation, initially low, greatly improved during diuresis in younger subjects, whereas PGE2 excretion increased. In older women, however, water diuresis elicited no change in oxygenation of renal medulla or PGE2 excretion. Ibuprofen inhibited excretion of PGE2 and blocked the increase in medullary oxygenation normally produced by water diuresis in the young. Conclusions. The increase in oxygenation of the renal medulla accompanying water diuresis depends on PGE2 synthesis. Attenuation of renal PGE2 synthesis in older people is probably responsible, at least in part, for the loss of the ability to improve medullary oxygenation that younger subjects possess. Inability to improve renal medullary oxygenation might predispose to hypoxic renal injury in older patients.},

In an animal model, inhibition of the synthesis of nitric oxide and prostaglandins appears to predispose rats to severe renal injury following the administration of radiocontrast. Here we have investigated whether administration of radiocontrast, as well as changes in renal medullary oxygenation following pharmacologic inhibition of nitric oxide and prostaglandin synthesis, might be evaluated by blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI. Nineteen anesthetized (Inactin 100 mg/kg) rats were studied. BOLD MRI measurements were performed following administration of L-NAME (N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, 10 mg/kg), Indomethacin (10 mg/kg), and a radiocontrast agent (sodium iothalamate 60\%, 6 mL/kg). Marked sequential changes in medullary R\,*2, presumably reflecting decline in medullary pO2, were noted after each of the pharmacological interventions employed. These results, obtained by noninvasive MRI, are consistent with prior direct recordings of pO2 and doppler flow in the rat renal medulla after administration of L-NAME, Indomethacin and iothalamate. Medullary oxygenation in rats was reduced by inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins and nitric oxide, as well as by intravenous injection of radiocontrast agents.

  abstract = {BOLD-MRI (blood oxygenation-level dependent magnetic resonance imaging) allows non-invasive measurement of renal tissue oxygenation in humans, without the need for contrast products. BOLD-MRI uses the fact that magnetic properties of hemoglobin depend of its oxygenated state:: the higher local deoxyhemoglobin, the higher the so called apparent relaxation rate R2* (sec-1), and the lower local tissue oxygen content. Several factors other than deoxyhemoglobin (such as hydration status, dietary sodium intake, and susceptibility effects) influence the BOLD signal, and need to be taken into account when interpreting results. The last 5 years have witnessed important improvements in the standardization of these factors, and the appearance of new, highly reproducible analysis techniques of BOLD-images, that are reviewed in this article. Using these new BOLD-MRI analysis techniques, it has recently been shown that persons suffering from chronic kidney diseases (CKD) have lower cortical oxygenation than normotensive controls, thus confirming the chronic hypoxia hypothesis. The acute alterations in R2* after the administration of furosemide are smaller in CKD, and represent an estimate of the oxygen-dependent tubular transport of sodium. BOLD-MRI-alone or in combination with other functional MRI methods- can be used to monitor the renal effects of drugs, and is increasingly used in the preclinical setting. The near future will tell whether or not BOLD-MRI represents a new tool to predict renal function decline an adverse renal outcome.},

Renal oxygenation was measured using blood oxygen level\textendash{}dependent magnetic resonance. Tissue oxygenation was determined by the measurement of R2* maps on 4 coronal slices covering both kidneys. The mean R2* values in the medulla and cortex were calculated, with a low R2* indicating a high tissue oxygenation. Ten male NT (mean age: 26.5{$\pm$}7.4 years) and 8 matched HT subjects (mean age: 28.8{$\pm$}5.7 years) were studied. Cortical R2* was not different under the 2 conditions of salt intake. Medullary R2* was significantly lower under low sodium than high sodium in both NT and HT subjects (28.1{$\pm$}0.8 versus 31.3{$\pm$}0.6 s-1; P{$<$}0.05 in NT; and 27.9{$\pm$}1.5 versus 30.3{$\pm$}0.8 s-1; P{$<$}0.05, in HT), indicating higher medullary oxygenation under low-sodium conditions. In NT subjects, medullary oxygenation was positively correlated with proximal reabsorption of sodium and negatively with absolute distal sodium reabsorption, but not with renal plasma flow. In HT subjects, medullary oxygenation correlated with the 24-hour sodium excretion but not with proximal or with the distal handling of sodium. These data demonstrate that dietary sodium intake influences renal tissue oxygenation, low sodium intake leading to an increased renal medullary oxygenation both in normotensive and young hypertensive subjects.},

The Harvey-Bradshaw index, the C-reactive protein level, and disease chronicity were recorded. The resected bowel was retrospectively identified at preoperative MR imaging, and wall thickness, mural and lymph node/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal intensity ratios on T2-weighted fat-saturated images, gadolinium-based contrast material uptake, enhancement pattern, and mesenteric signal intensity on T2-weighted fat-saturated images were recorded. Precise histologic matching was achieved by imaging the ex vivo surgical specimens. Histopathologic grading of acute inflammation with the acute inflammatory score (AIS) (on the basis of mucosal ulceration, edema, and quantity and depth of neutrophilic infiltration) and the degree of fibrostenosis was performed at each site, and results were compared with MR imaging features. Data were analyzed by using linear regression with robust standard errors of the estimate. ResultsAIS was positively correlated with mural thickness and mural/CSF signal intensity ratio on T2-weighted fat-saturated images (P {$<$} .001 and P = .003, respectively) but not with mural enhancement at 30 and 70 seconds (P = .50 and P = .73, respectively). AIS was higher with layered mural enhancement (P {$<$} .001), a pattern also commonly associated with coexisting fibrostenosis (75\%). Mural/CSF signal intensity ratio on T2-weighted fat-saturated images was higher in histologically edematous bowel than in nonedematous bowel (P = .04). There was no correlation between any lymph node characteristic and AIS. ConclusionIncreasing mural thickness, high mural signal intensity on T2-weighted fat-saturated images, and a layered pattern of enhancement reflect histologic features of acute small-bowel inflammation in Crohn disease.Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/radiol.2523082167/DC1\textcopyright{} RSNA, 2009},

  abstract = {This study characterizes the diffusion anisotropy of the human kidney using a diffusion-weighted, single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence in order to access the full apparent diffusion tensor (ADT) within one breathhold. The fractional anisotropy (FA) of the cortex and the medulla were found to be 0.22 {$\pm$} 0.12 and 0.39 {$\pm$} 0.11, respectively (N = 10), which emphasizes the need for rotationally invariant diffusion measurements for clinical applications. Additional limitations for clinical diffusion imaging on the kidney are the strong susceptibility variations within the abdomen that restrict the use of imaging techniques employing long echo trains, and the severe motion sensitivity that limits the available imaging time to one breath-hold. To overcome these problems an isotropic, diffusion-weighted, segmented EPI protocol that facilitates the acquisition of high-resolution diffusion-weighted images within a single breath-hold was implemented. Using this method, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the cortex and medulla were found to be 2.89 {$\pm$} 0.28 {$\cdot$} 10-9 m2/s and 2.18 {$\pm$} 0.36 {$\cdot$} 10-9 m2/s (N = 10). J.

The aim of this study was to characterize the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings that are differentially associated with the presence of fibrosis and those associated with inflammatory activity, using the pathological analysis of surgically resected intestinal lesions as reference standard.Methods:MRI studies with identical imaging protocol of 41 CD patients who underwent elective bowel resection within 4 months before surgery were reviewed. MRI evaluated wall thickening, edema, ulcers, signal intensity at submucosa at 70 s and 7 min after gadolinium injection, stenosis, and pattern of enhancement in each phase of the dynamic study and changes on this pattern over time. Pathological inflammatory and fibrosis scores were classified into three grades of severity.Results:In all, 44 segments from 41 patients were analyzed. The pathological intensity of inflammation was associated with the following MRI parameters: hypersignal on T2 (P=0.02), mucosal enhancement (P=0.03), ulcerations (P=0.01), and blurred margins (P=0.05). The degree of fibrosis correlated with the percentage of enhancement gain (P{$<$}0.01), the pattern of enhancement at 7 min (P{$<$}0.01), and the presence of stenosis (P=0.05). Using percentage of enhancement gain, MRI is able to discriminate between mild\textendash{}moderate and severe fibrosis deposition with a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.89.Conclusions:MRI is accurate for detecting the presence of severe fibrosis in CD lesions on the basis of the enhancement pattern.},

  abstract = {The pathological changes in 50 percutaneous renal-biopsy specimens from patients with persistent glomerular nephritis have been analysed. Techniques were developed which allowed glomerular and tubular lesions to be assessed quantitatively. A highly significant correlation was found between the extent of tubular damage and creatinine clearance, plasma-creatinine, and the ability to concentrate and to acidify the urine. A less significant correlation was found between the extent of the structural changes in the glomeruli and creatinine clearance, plasma-creatinine, and the ability to concentrate the urine. In some patients with inconspicuous glomerular changes but severe tubular damage, the creatinine clearance was grossly reduced; conversely, in some patients with extensive glomerular changes but little or no tubular damage, the creatinine clearances were normal. It is concluded that in persistent glomerular nephritis the glomerular filtration-rate is more affected by changes in the tubules than by changes in the glomeruli. Degenerative changes in the renal arterioles tended to occur significantly more often with increasing age and with increasing diastolic blood-pressure. The severity of the structural changes in the glomeruli correlated significantly with the presence of hyaline arteriolar change; the extent of tubular atrophy correlated significantly with the presence of fibroelastic intimal hyperplasia.},

  abstract = {We describe methods for simultaneously acquiring and subsequently combining data from a multitude of closely positioned NMR receiving coils. The approach is conceptually similar to phased array radar and ultrasound and hence we call our techniques the ``NMR phased array.'' The NMR phased array offers the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and resolution of a small surface coil over fields-of-view (FOV) normally associated with body imaging with no increase in imaging time. The NMR phased array can be applied to both imaging and spectroscopy for all pulse sequences. The problematic interactions among nearby surface coils is eliminated (a) by overlapping adjacent coils to give zero mutual inductance, hence zero interaction, and (b) by attaching low input impedance preamplifiers to all coils, thus eliminating interference among next nearest and more distant neighbors. We derive an algorithm for combining the data from the phased array elements to yield an image with optimum SNR. Other techniques which are easier to implement at the cost of lower SNR are explored. Phased array imaging is demonstrated with high resolution (512 \texttimes{} 512, 48-cm FOV, and 32-cm FOV) spin-echo images of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Data were acquired from four-element linear spine arrays, the first made of 12-cm square coils and the second made of 8-cm square coils. When compared with images from a single 15 \texttimes{} 30-cm rectangular coil and identical imaging parameters, the phased array yields a 2X and 3X higher SNR at the depth of the spine ( {$\sim$} 7 cm). \textcopyright{} 1990 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Objectives In human chronic kidney disease (CKD) the extent of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis correlates with progressive loss of renal function. However, fibrosis can so far only be assessed by histology of kidney biopsies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information about tissue architecture, but its potential to assess fibrosis and inflammation in diseased kidneys remains poorly defined. Materials and methods We evaluated excised kidneys in a murine adenine-induced nephropathy model for CKD by MRI and correlated quantitative MRI parameters (T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy) with histological hallmarks of progressive CKD, including renal fibrosis, inflammation, and microvascular rarefaction. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of paraformaldehyde fixation on MRI parameters by comparing kidney samples before and after fixation with paraformaldehyde. Results In diseased kidneys T2 and T2* relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy in the renal cortex and/or outer medulla were significantly different from those in control kidneys. In particular, T2 relaxation time was the best parameter to distinguish control and CKD groups and correlated very well with the extent of fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrates, tubular dilation, crystal deposition, and loss of peritubular capillaries and normal tubules in the renal cortex and outer medulla. Fixation with paraformaldehyde had no impact on T2 relaxation time and fractional anisotropy, whereas T1 times significantly decreased and T2* times and apparent diffusion coefficients increased in fixed kidney tissue. Conclusions MRI parameters provide a promising approach to quantitatively assess renal fibrosis and inflammation in CKD. Especially T2 relaxation time correlates well with histological features of CKD and is not influenced by paraformaldehyde fixation of kidney samples. Thus, T2 relaxation time might be a candidate parameter for non-invasive assessment of renal fibrosis in human patients.},

We will review how recent studies are attempting to verify the accuracy of laminar fMRI by recreating the known laminar profiles of various neural tuning properties.

  abstract = {Several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrasts are sensitive to myelin content in gray matter in vivo which has ignited ambitions of MRI-based in vivo cortical histology. Ultra-high field (UHF) MRI, at fields of 7T and beyond, is crucial to provide the resolution and contrast needed to sample contrasts over the depth of the cortex and get closer to layer resolved imaging. Ex vivo MRI of human post mortem samples is an important stepping stone to investigate MRI contrast in the cortex, validate it against histology techniques applied in situ to the same tissue, and investigate the resolutions needed to translate ex vivo findings to in vivo UHF MRI. Here, we investigate key technology to extend such UHF studies to large human brain samples while maintaining high resolution, which allows investigation of the layered architecture of several cortical areas over their entire 3D extent and their complete borders where architecture changes. A 16 channel cylindrical phased array radiofrequency (RF) receive coil was constructed to image a large post mortem occipital lobe sample (\textasciitilde{}80\texttimes{}80\texttimes{}80mm3) in a wide-bore 9.4T human scanner with the aim of achieving high-resolution anatomical and quantitative MR images. Compared with a human head coil at 9.4T, the maximum Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) was increased by a factor of about five in the peripheral cortex. Although the transmit profile with a circularly polarized transmit mode at 9.4T is relatively inhomogeneous over the large sample, this challenge was successfully resolved with parallel transmit using the kT-points method. Using this setup, we achieved 60{$\mu$}m anatomical images for the entire occipital lobe showing increased spatial definition of cortical details compared to lower resolutions. In addition, we were able to achieve sufficient control over SNR, B0 and B1 homogeneity and multi-contrast sampling to perform quantitative T2* mapping over the same volume at 200{$\mu$}m. Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling provided maximum posterior estimates of quantitative T2* and their uncertainty, allowing delineation of the stria of Gennari over the entire length and width of the calcarine sulcus. We discuss how custom RF receive coil arrays built to specific large post mortem sample sizes can provide a platform for UHF cortical layer-specific quantitative MRI over large fields of view.},

Therefore the purposes of the study were to develop and evaluate a semi-automated segmentation tool and a modified ellipsoid formula for volumetric analysis of the kidney in non-contrast T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR)-images. Three readers performed semi-automated segmentation of the total kidney volume (TKV) in axial, non-contrast-enhanced T2-weighted MR-images of 24 healthy volunteers (48 kidneys) twice. A semi-automated threshold-based segmentation tool was developed to segment the kidney parenchyma. Furthermore, the three readers measured renal dimensions (length, width, depth) and applied different formulas to calculate the TKV. Manual segmentation served as a reference volume. Volumes of the different methods were compared and time required was recorded. There was no significant difference between the semi-automatically and manually segmented TKV (p = 0.31). The difference in mean volumes was 0.3 ml (95\% confidence interval (CI), -10.1 to 10.7 ml). Semi-automated segmentation was significantly faster than manual segmentation, with a mean difference = 188 s (220 vs. 408 s); p {$<$} 0.05. Volumes did not differ significantly comparing the results of different readers. Calculation of TKV with a modified ellipsoid formula (ellipsoid volume \texttimes{} 0.85) did not differ significantly from the reference volume; however, the mean error was three times higher (difference of mean volumes -0.1 ml; CI -31.1 to 30.9 ml; p = 0.95). Applying the modified ellipsoid formula was the fastest way to get an estimation of the renal volume (41 s). Semi-automated segmentation and volumetric analysis of the kidney in native T2-weighted MR data delivers accurate and reproducible results and was significantly faster than manual segmentation. Applying a modified ellipsoid formula quickly provides an accurate kidney volume.},

  abstract = {Purpose

Arranging transmit array elements in multiple rows provides an additional degree of freedom to correct B1+ field inhomogeneities and to achieve whole-brain excitation at ultrahigh field strengths. Receive arrays shaped to the contours of the anatomy increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the image. In this work, the advantages offered by the transmit and receive array techniques are combined for human brain imaging at 9.4 T.

Methods

A 16-element dual-row transmit array and a 31-element receive array were developed. Based on an accurate numerical model of the transmit array, the deposited power was calculated for different head sizes and positions. The influence of the receive array on the transmit field was characterized. Parallel imaging performance and signal-to-noise ratio of the receive array were evaluated.

Results

On average, a two fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio was observed in the whole-brain volume when compared with a 16-channel elliptic microstrip transceiver array. The benefits of combining the two arrays, B1+ shimming in three directions and high receive sensitivity, are demonstrated with high-resolution in vivo images.

Conclusion

The dual-row transmit array provides whole-brain coverage at 9.4 T, which, in combination with the helmet-shaped receive array, is a valuable radio frequency configuration for ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain.

  abstract = {Purpose: Postmortem MRI can be used to reveal important pathologies and establish radiology-pathology correlations. However, quantitative MRI values are altered by tissue fixation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate time-dependent effects of formalin fixation on MRI relaxometry (T1 and T2), diffusion tensor imaging (fractional anisotropy, FA; and mean diffusivity, MD), and myelin water fraction (MWF) measurements throughout intact human brain specimens. Methods: Two whole, neurologically-healthy human brains were immersed in 10\% formalin solution and scanned at 13 time-points between 0 and 1032 hours. Whole brain maps of longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times, FA, MD, and MWF were generated at each time-point to illustrate spatiotemporal changes, and region-of-interest analyses were then performed in eight brain structures to quantify temporal changes with progressive fixation. Results: Although neither of the diffusion measures (FA nor MD) showed significant changes as a function of formalin fixation time, both T1 and T2-relaxation times significantly decreased, and MWF estimates significantly increased with progressive fixation until (and likely beyond) our final measurements were taken at 1032 hours. Conclusions: These results suggest that T1-relaxation, T2-relaxation and MWF estimates must be performed quite early in the fixation process to avoid formalin-induced changes compared to in vivo values; and furthermore, that different ex vivo scans within an experiment must be acquired at consistent (albeit still early) fixation intervals to avoid fixative-related differences between samples. Conversely, ex vivo diffusion measures (FA and MD) appear to depend more on other factors (e.g., pulse sequence optimization, sample temperature, etc.).},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Accurate longitudinal relaxation time (T{$_1$}) of arterial blood is important in evaluating blood flow in tissue by arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Few studies have reported the T{$_1$} of human arterial blood in vivo, especially using 3-tesla MR imaging. T{$_1$} values of human venous blood in vivo have been reported, but they differ from those measured in vitro. We aimed to evaluate the accurate T{$_1$} of human arterial blood in vivo.
METHODS: We measured T{$_1$} values of blood in 10 healthy volunteers in vivo using an inversion-recovery fast gradient-echo sequence and 3-tesla MR imaging unit. We also measured hematocrit (Hct) values of venous blood samples. After nonselective application of the inversion pulse using a body coil, we obtained MR imaging signals of arterial blood in the abdominal aorta. Similarly, we measured the signals of venous blood in the internal jugular vein. Inversion times varied between 200 and 5000 ms for imaging of the abdominal aorta and 200 and 2500 ms for imaging of the jugular vein. We also acquired signals without the inversion pulse. We estimated T{$_1$} values from the data by nonlinear least squares fitting of a 3-parameter model.
RESULTS: The T value (mean{$\pm$}standard deviation) of arterial blood was 1779{$\pm$}80 ms and of venous blood, 1694{$\pm$}77 ms. The average Hct value was 0.47. The R{$_1$} (=1/T{$_1$}) of arterial blood was related to the Hct value as: R{$_1$}=(0.59{$\pm$}0.16)Hct+(0.29{$\pm$}0.07) (mean{$\pm$}standard error) s{$^{-1}$}. For the venous blood, R{$_1$}=(0.70{$\pm$}0.11)Hct+(0.27{$\pm$}0.05) s{$^{-1}$}.
CONCLUSION: We observed a T{$_1$} of human arterial blood in vivo of 1779{$\pm$}80 ms at a mean hematocrit value of 0.47 as determined by 3T MR imaging; an even longer T{$_1$} value is expected with a hematocrit value less than 0.47.},

To determine the tracking factor by studying the relationship between kidney and diaphragm motions and to compare the efficiency of the gating-and-following and gating-only algorithms in reducing motion artifacts in navigator-gated scans.
Materials and Methods
Diaphragm and kidney motions were measured by using real-time TrueFISP sequences from 10 healthy human volunteers to determine tracking factors at different acceptance windows. Mean tracking factors were used to calculate mean residual errors and improvement factors for the gating-and-following and gating-only algorithms.
Results
Mean tracking factors for {$\pm$}4, {$\pm$}6, {$\pm$}8 mm and full acceptance windows ranged from 0.6 to 0.7, with large interindividual variations. Acceptance rates increased as the size of the acceptance window increased (acceptance rate for a 4 mm window {$\sim$}50\%). There was a greater reduction of motion errors by gating-and-following (maximum of 1.86 mm) than gating-only (maximum of 7.05 mm).
Conclusion
Mean tracking factors obtained in this study can be used as a guideline for using the gating-and-following algorithm in navigator-gated kidney scans. The gating-and-following and gating-only algorithms were quantitatively compared, and it was found that the former is more effective in reducing motion errors. J. Magn. Reson.

Subject motion may cause errors in estimates of blood T2 when using the T2-relaxation under spin tagging (TRUST) technique on noncompliant subjects like neonates. By incorporating 3D volume navigators (vNavs) into the TRUST pulse sequence, independent measurements of motion during scanning permit evaluation of these errors.

Methods

The effects of integrated vNavs on TRUST-based T2 estimates were evaluated using simulations and in vivo subject data. Two subjects were scanned with the TRUST+vNav sequence during prescribed movements. Mean motion scores were derived from vNavs and TRUST images, along with a metric of exponential fit quality. Regression analysis was performed between T2 estimates and mean motion scores. Also, motion scores were determined from independent neonatal scans.

Results

vNavs negligibly affected venous blood T2 estimates and better detected subject motion than fit quality metrics. Regression analysis showed that T2 is biased upward by 4.1 ms per 1\,mm of mean motion score. During neonatal scans, mean motion scores of 0.6 to 2.0\,mm were detected.

Conclusion

Motion during TRUST causes an overestimate of T2, which suggests a cautious approach when comparing TRUST-based cerebral oxygenation measurements of noncompliant subjects. Magn Reson Med, 2017. \textcopyright{} 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.},

To develop an image reconstruction algorithm that restores the signal polarity in a three-dimensional inversion-recovery (3D-IR) sequence used in delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC). This approach effectively doubles the dynamic range of data used for T1 curve fitting.

Materials and Methods:

We applied this reconstruction algorithm to a 3D-IR TFE sequence used for T1 mapping, validated the technique in a phantom study, and performed T1-map calculations in postosteochondral allograft transplant (OAT) patients. In addition, we performed a signal simulation study to assess the algorithm's capability to reduce the number of inversion times used in the 3D-IR TFE sequence.

Results:

In comparison to a standard T1-mapping algorithm that uses the magnitude of the MRI signal, the proposed algorithm improves the reliability of T1 relaxation fits to the inversion-recovery three-parameter function. The signal simulation study shows that the number of TI inversion times can be reduced to as few as four, without compromising the accuracy of T1 calculations.

Conclusion:

This algorithm can be applied to any 2D- or 3D-IR acquisition sequence used in conjunction with dGEMRIC. Application of the algorithm improves the reliability of T1 calculations and allows the number of TIs to be reduced, leading to shorter scan times in dGEMRIC. J. Magn. Reson.

  abstract = {Purpose of review:Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited disorder characterized by the formation of kidney cysts and kidney enlargement, which progresses to kidney failure by the fifth to seventh decade of life in a majority of patients. Disease progression is evaluated primarily through serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements; however, it is known that serum creatinine and eGFR values typically do not change until the fourth or fifth decade of life. Until recently, therapy only existed to target complications of ADPKD. As therapeutic agents continue to be investigated for use in ADPKD, a suitable biomarker of disease progression in place of serum creatinine is needed.Sources of information:This review summarizes recent research regarding the use of total kidney volume as a biomarker in ADPKD, as presented at the Canadian Society of Nephrology symposium held in April 2015.Findings:Measurement of patients? total kidney volume made using ultrasound (US) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown by the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) study to be directly correlated with both increases in cyst volume and change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Additional studies have shown total kidney volume to have an association with complications of ADPKD as well.Limitations:Areas for further study continue to exist in comparison of methods of measuring total kidney volume.Implications:We believe that the evidence suggests that total kidney volume may be an appropriate surrogate marker for ADPKD disease progression.},

This time fits well into the existing gaps in sequences routinely used for neuroimaging, thus giving a motion-corrected sequence with no extra time required. We also demonstrate motion-driven selective reacquisition of k-space to further compensate for subject motion. We perform multiple validation experiments to evaluate accuracy, navigator impact on tissue intensity/contrast, and the improvement in final output.

Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to non-invasively evaluate intra-renal oxygenation levels of the renal medulla in humans. A newly implemented three-dimensional (3-D) multiple gradient-recalled echo sequence, which permits examination of temporal responses to physiological or pharmacological stimuli, was used to monitor changes in intra-renal oxygenation status during water diuresis. Five healthy, young subjects (22{$\pm$}1.2 years) took part in the study. BOLD MRI data were acquired before and after water loading. Studies were repeated on a separate day after the subjects were pretreated with naproxen. Water diuresis significantly improved renal medullary oxygenation levels in all subjects (pre-waterload=30.3 1/s vs post-waterload 22.8 1/s); however, the temporal response was found to be subject dependent. In the presence of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition by naproxen, the improvement in oxygenation during water diuresis was completely abolished (pre-waterload=27.5 1/s vs post-waterload 28.5 1/s). Monitoring of temporal responses for the first time during water loading allowed for an appreciation of subject dependence. Comparison of the temporal response in terms of slopes demonstrated a significant difference between the waterload studies with and without naproxen (with naproxen=0.056 1/(s min) vs without naproxen=0.25 1/(s min)). The observed effects of naproxen were consistent with previous findings with COX inhibition.},

  abstract = {Aim~Ultrasound tissue characterization (USTC) is a precursor of ultrasound virtual histology (USVH), already applied to B-mode images of coronary, carotid, and peripheral arteries, as well as venous thrombosis. Elevated echogenicity has been described for a rejected transplanted kidney. We analyzed data from healthy young adults as reference for further renal USTC.
        Methods~Ultrasound kidney images of 10 volunteers were analyzed. Pixel brightness in the 0-to-255 range was rescaled to zero for black and 200 for fascia brightness before automatic classification into 14 ranges, including ``blood-like'' (0\textendash{}4), ``fat-like'' (8\textendash{}26), ``hypoechoic muscle-like'' (41\textendash{}60), ``hyperechoic muscle-like'' (61\textendash{}76), 4 ranges of ``fiber-like'' (112\textendash{}196), ``calcium-like'' (211\textendash{}255) and intermediary intervals. Nomenclature was readapted using nonechoic, hypoechoic I to IV, echoic I to IV, hyperechoic I to IV, and saturated echoes to avoid inference to actual kidney tissue. Descriptive and comparative statistics were based on percentages of pixels in specific brightness ranges.
        Sample Population~Eight women and 2 men, 26 {$\pm$} 4 years (range, 22\textendash{}34 years) old, were studied. Kidney length was 10.5 {$\pm$} 0.9 cm (9.0\textendash{}12.0 cm). Doppler US resistivity index was 0.67 {$\pm$} 0.03 (0.62\textendash{}0.71).
        Results~Original fascia brightness converted to 200 value had a mean {$\pm$} SD of 206 {$\pm$} 16 (range, 181\textendash{}236). Kidney grayscale median averaged 37 {$\pm$} 6 (27\textendash{}48). Most pixels were hypoechoic II to IV (8\textendash{}60), averaging 78\% {$\pm$} 6\% (66\%\textendash{}87\%). Percentages for fat-like, intermediary fat/muscle-like, and hypoechoic muscle-like intervals averaged 25\%, 28\%, and 25\%, respectively.
        Conclusions~A reference database for USTC/USVH of normal young kidneys was created for future comparisons with transplanted and abnormal kidneys. Normal renal echoes have low brightness. Hyperechoic pixels may represent abnormalities.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of quantifying functional renal volume with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained, and all subjects gave informed consent. A contour-detection three-dimensional algorithm for determining renal volumes was developed. The method was validated in 18 cadaveric pig kidneys by measuring the water displacement caused by the kidneys. The kidney lengths and volumes in 19 consecutive potential kidney donors who underwent gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography of the renal arteries also were determined. Differences in volume measurements between men and women and between left and right kidneys were analyzed by using the Student t test. The volume of perfused renal cortex was calculated by extracting voxels on the basis of the cortex signal intensity threshold. The relevance of renal function parameters\textemdash{}namely, creatinine clearance rates\textemdash{}in the donor candidates was assessed by using a linear regression model. Intra- and interobserver variabilities of the measurements were determined by using the Bland-Altman method.RESULTS: Volume measurements of the cadaveric pig kidneys obtained by using MR angiography and the water displacement method were strongly correlated (r = 0.99). The mean total renal volume in the donor candidates was 196 mL (range, 136\textendash{}295 mL). No significant differences in total renal volume between the men and women or between the left and right kidneys were found. The correlation between calculated renal cortex volumes (mean, 67 mL; range, 40\textendash{}105 mL) and creatinine clearance rates was good (r = 0.69). Inter- and intraobserver variabilities were lower than 7\%.CONCLUSION: Quantification of functional renal volume with three-dimensional gadolinium-enhanced MR angiography seems feasible with use of the described semiautomatic method.\textcopyright{} RSNA, 2005},

It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

  abstract = {We introduce DeepNAT, a 3D Deep convolutional neural network for the automatic segmentation of NeuroAnaTomy in T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. DeepNAT is an end-to-end learning-based approach to brain segmentation that jointly learns an abstract feature representation and a multi-class classification. We propose a 3D patch-based approach, where we do not only predict the center voxel of the patch but also neighbors, which is formulated as multi-task learning. To address a class imbalance problem, we arrange two networks hierarchically, where the first one separates foreground from background, and the second one identifies 25 brain structures on the foreground. Since patches lack spatial context, we augment them with coordinates. To this end, we introduce a novel intrinsic parameterization of the brain volume, formed by eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As network architecture, we use three convolutional layers with pooling, batch normalization, and non-linearities, followed by fully connected layers with dropout. The final segmentation is inferred from the probabilistic output of the network with a 3D fully connected conditional random field, which ensures label agreement between close voxels. The roughly 2.7million parameters in the network are learned with stochastic gradient descent. Our results show that DeepNAT compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the purely learning-based method may have a high potential for the adaptation to young, old, or diseased brains by fine-tuning the pre-trained network with a small training sample on the target application, where the availability of larger datasets with manual annotations may boost the overall segmentation accuracy in the future.},

  abstract = {Improvements in the spatial resolution of structural and functional MRI are beginning to enable analysis of intracortical structures such as heavily myelinated layers in 3D, a prerequisite for in-vivo parcellation of individual human brains. This parcellation can only be performed precisely if the profiles used in cortical analysis are anatomically meaningful. Profiles are often constructed as traverses that are perpendicular to computed laminae. In this case they are fully determined by these laminae. The aim of this study is to evaluate models for cortical laminae used so far and to establish a new model. Methods to model the laminae used so far include constructing laminae that keep a constant distance to the cortical boundaries, so-called equidistant laminae. Another way is to compute equipotentials between the cortical boundary surfaces with the Laplace equation. The Laplace profiles resulting from the gradients to the equipotentials were often-used because of their nice mathematical properties. However, the equipotentials these Laplacian profiles are constructed from and the equidistant laminae do not follow the anatomical layers observed using high resolution MRI of cadaver brain. To remedy this problem, we introduce a novel equi-volume model that derives from work by Bok (1929). He argued that cortical segments preserve their volume, while layer thickness changes to compensate cortical folding. We incorporate this preservation of volume in our new equi-volume model to generate a three-dimensional well-adapted undistorted coordinate system of the cortex. When defined by this well-adapted coordinate system, cortical depth is anatomically meaningful. We compare isocontours from these cortical depth values to locations of myelinated bands on high-resolution ex-vivo and in-vivo three-dimensional MR images. A similar comparison was performed with equipotentials computed with the Laplace equation and with equidistant isocontours. A quantitative evaluation of the equi-volume model using measured image intensities confirms that it provides a much better fit to observed cortical layering.},

A questionnaire regarding surgical approach and planning was administered. The presumed pre-operative approaches with and without the model were compared. Any change between the presumed approaches and the actual surgical intervention was recorded.ResultsThere was a change in planned approach with the 3D printed model for all ten cases with the largest impact seen regarding decisions on transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach and clamping, with changes seen in 30\%\textendash{}50\% of cases. Mean parenchymal volume loss for the operated kidney was 21.4\%.

  abstract = {The maximum tetanic tension of skeletal muscle (P0) is often estimated based on calculation of physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). PCSA depends on muscle volume, pennation angle, and fiber length. Studies documenting PCSA in fixed human muscles usually compute muscle volume by dividing muscle mass by density. These studies use a density value of 1.0597g/cm3, which was originally based on unfixed rabbit and canine muscle tissue. Due to the dehydration effects of different fixation methods, the variable hydration that occurs when fixed tissue is stored in buffered saline, and the potential for species-specific muscle density, this value may be incorrect and an accurate value for fixed human muscle density is needed. To obtain an accurate density and water content values, 4\% formaldehyde-fixed (n=54) and 37\% formaldehyde-fixed (n=54) cadaveric human muscle samples were divided into 6 groups (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, or 30h) for hydration in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Measurements of volume, water content, and mass were made enabling calculation of muscle density. Additionally, water content was measured in living muscle (n=4) to determine the appropriate hydration time in PBS. Comparisons among groups demonstrated a significant increase in muscle water content and muscle volume over time, reaching living tissue levels after 24h, but, interestingly, the hydration process did not affect muscle density. These data yield a density value (mean{$\pm$}SE) of 1.112{$\pm$}0.006g/cm3 in 4\% formaldehyde-fixed muscle and 1.055{$\pm$}0.006g/cm3 in 37\% formaldehyde-fixed muscle.

  abstract = {Purpose Abnormalities in hepatic oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption may serve as a significant indicator of hepatic cellular dysfunction and may predict treatment response. However, conventional and oxygen-enhanced hepatic BOLD MRI can only provide semiquantitative assessment of hepatic oxygenation. Methods A hepatic quantitative BOLD (qBOLD) model was proposed for noninvasive mapping of hepatic venous blood oxygen saturation (Yv) and deoxygenated blood volume (DBV) in human subjects. The validity and the estimation bias of the proposed model were evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. Eight healthy subjects were scanned after written consent with institutional review board approval. Results Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the proposed single-compartment hepatic qBOLD model leads to significant deviation of the predicted T2* decay profile from the simulated signal due to high hepatic blood volume fraction. Small relative estimation bias for hepatic Yv and significant overestimation for hepatic DBV were observed, which can be corrected by applying the calibration curves established from simulations. After correction, the mean hepatic Yv in human subjects was 56.8 {$\pm$} 6.8\%, and the mean hepatic DBV was 0.190 {$\pm$} 0.035, consistent with measurements from other invasive approaches. Except in regions with significant vascular contamination, the maps for hepatic Yv and DBV were relatively homogenous.

Two data sets (each acquired in one breath-hold) were co-registered using a rigid registration algorithm compensating for possible breathing-related displacements. An automatic algorithm based on thresholding and shape detection segmented the kidneys into their compartments and was compared to a manual labeling procedure.ResultsThe resulting kidney volumes of the automated segmentation correlated well with those created manually (R 2 = 0.96). Average volume errors were determined to be 4.97 {$\pm$} 4.08 \% (entire kidney parenchyma), 7.03 {$\pm$} 5.56 \% (cortex), 12.33 {$\pm$} 7.35 \% (medulla), and 17.57 {$\pm$} 14.47 \% (pelvis). The variation of the kidney volume resulting from the automatic algorithm was found to be 4.76 \% based on the measuring of one volunteer with three independent examinations.ConclusionThe results demonstrate the feasibility of an accurate and repeatable automatic segmentation of the kidneys and their internal structures from non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images.},

To this end, a sequence is presented for determining the T2 of vascular blood in regions in which motions of the body and of the blood itself present a major challenge. With use of this sequence on a commercial 1.5-T whole-body imager, the relationship between the T2 and \%HbO2 of blood is calibrated in vitro for the conditions expected in vivo. T2 varies predictably from about 30 to 250 msec as \%HbO2 varies from 30\% to 96\%. T2 values measured in situ for vascular blood in the mediastinum of several healthy subjects qualitatively reflected the behavior observed in vitro. Estimates of \%HbO2 for these vessels obtained with the in vitro calibration appear reasonable, particularly for venous blood, although difficulties arise in selecting the appropriate calibration factors. These encouraging initial results support a more systematic study of potential sources of error and an examination of the accuracy of in vivo measurements by comparison with direct measurements of \%HbO2 in vessels.},

  abstract = {Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine whether susceptibility tensor imaging (STI) could overcome limitations of current techniques to detect tubules throughout the kidney.

Methods

Normal mouse kidneys (n\,=\,4) were imaged at 9.4T using a three-dimensional gradient multi-echo sequence (55-micron isotropic resolution). Phase images from 12 orientations were obtained to compute the susceptibility tensor. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with 12 encoding directions was compared with STI. Tractography was performed to visualize and track the course of tubules with DTI and STI. Confocal microscopy was used to identify which tubular segments of the nephron were detected by DTI and STI.

Results

Diffusion anisotropy was limited to the inner medulla of the kidney. DTI did not find a significant number of coherent tubular tracks in the outer medulla or cortex. With STI, we found strong susceptibility anisotropy and many tracks in the inner and outer medulla and in limited areas of the cortex.

Conclusion

STI was able to track tubules throughout the kidney, whereas DTI was limited to the inner medulla. STI provides a novel contrast mechanism related to local tubule microstructure and may offer a powerful method to study the nephron.

  abstract = {A T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) technique was recently developed to estimate cerebral blood oxygenation, providing potentials for non-invasive assessment of the brain's oxygen consumption. A limitation of the current sequence is the need for long TR, as shorter TR causes an over-estimation in blood R2. The present study proposes a post-saturation TRUST by placing a non-selective 90\textdegree{} pulse after the signal acquisition to reset magnetization in the whole brain. This scheme was found to eliminate estimation bias at a slight cost of precision. To improve the precision, TE of the sequence was optimized and it was found that a modest TE shortening of 3.4ms can reduce the estimation error by 49\%. We recommend the use of post-saturation TRUST sequence with a TR of 3000ms and a TE of 3.6ms, which allows the determination of global venous oxygenation with scan duration of 1 minute 12 seconds and an estimation precision of {$\pm$}1\% (in units of oxygen saturation percentage).},

  abstract = {Purpose

To evaluate the potential utility of texture analysis of proton density maps for quantifying hepatic fibrosis in a murine model of hepatic fibrosis.

Materials and Methods

Following Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval, a dietary model of hepatic fibrosis was used and 15 ex vivo murine liver tissues were examined. All images were acquired using a 30 mm bore 11.7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner with a multiecho spin-echo sequence. A texture analysis was employed extracting multiple texture features including histogram-based, gray-level co-occurrence matrix-based (GLCM), gray-level run-length-based features (GLRL), gray level gradient matrix (GLGM), and Laws' features. Texture features were correlated with histopathologic and digital image analysis of hepatic fibrosis.

Results

Histogram features demonstrated very weak to moderate correlations (r\,=\,\textendash{}0.29 to 0.51) with hepatic fibrosis. GLCM features correlation and contrast demonstrated moderate-to-strong correlations (r\,=\,\textendash{}0.71 and 0.59, respectively) with hepatic fibrosis. Moderate correlations were seen between hepatic fibrosis and the GLRL feature short run low gray-level emphasis (SRLGE) (r\,=\,\textendash{}0. 51). GLGM features demonstrate very weak to weak correlations with hepatic fibrosis (r\,=\,\textendash{}0.27 to 0.09). Moderate correlations were seen between hepatic fibrosis and Laws' features L6 and L7 (r\,=\,0.58).

Conclusion

This study demonstrates the utility of texture analysis applied to proton density MRI in a murine liver fibrosis model and validates the potential utility of texture-based features for the noninvasive, quantitative assessment of hepatic fibrosis.

To assess the performance of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of renal fibrosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD), with histopathology as a reference standard.
Materials and methods
Forty patients with CKD and 30 healthy volunteers were recruited for the study. All participants underwent diffusion-weighted MRI. Renal biopsy was performed in 25 patients with CKD. Mean renal medullary and cortical apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were compared between CKD patients and the healthy volunteers. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to investigate the relationship between ADC values, serum creatinine (SCr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 24~h urinary protein (24h-UPRO), and renal histopathological scores.
Results
Cortical and medullary ADC values in the CKD group were significantly lower compared to those in the healthy controls. In the CKD group, a significant negative correlation was found between cortical ADC values and SCr/24h-UPRO, and significant positive correlation was found between cortical ADC and eGFR. There was also a significant negative correlation between medullary ADC values and SCr. Both cortical and medullary ADC values were significantly correlated with histopathological fibrosis score.
Conclusion
Renal ADC values strongly correlate with histological measures of fibrosis, and have the potential to enhance the non-invasive monitoring of chronic kidney disease.},

In a temperature controlled circulation system, these rates were measured for blood in vitro at 3T under conditions akin to the physiological state. Single spin echo (SE) and gradient echo (GRE) sequences were used to determine R2 and R, respectively. Both rates varied quadratically with deoxygenation, and changes in R were found to be due predominantly to changes in R2. These data were used to estimate intravascular blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contributions during visual activation. Due to the large R in venous blood, intravascular SE BOLD signal changes were larger than GRE effects at echo times above 30 ms. When including extravascular effects to estimate the total BOLD effect, GRE BOLD dominated due to the large tissue volume fraction.
