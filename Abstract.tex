The kidneys are morphologically and functionally complex organs and as such, lend themselves to complex methodologies of study. One such methodology is quantitative \ac{MRI}. Rather than simply taking an image of the kidneys, quantitative \ac{MRI} aims to measure physical properties such as rate of blood flow, venous oxygen saturation, tissue perfusion and more fundamental properties of the matter making up the organ such as its proton density or longitudinal relaxation time, \tone. This is done without the need for ionising radiation and often without exogenous contrast agents thus making \ac{MRI} an ideal tool for both clinical and research use.

Multiple methods have been developed to measure the transverse relaxation time, \ttwo, of the kidneys, often leading to inconsistent results between studies. Here a methodical comparison of the four prominent techniques is performed. This comparison makes use of quantitative phantoms before proceeding to assess each technique in-vivo in healthy volunteers. A \ac{GraSE} sequence is recommended for future renal \ttwo mapping.

Techniques to measure \ac{RMRO$_2$} would be highly desirable. \ac{SBO} and \ac{TRUST} are modified for use in the abdomen. \ac{SBO} is found to be poorly suited for use measuring oxygenation in the renal veins however \ac{TRUST} is used to successfully measure changes in venous oxygenation during an oxygen challenge.

Manual definition of renal \ac{ROI} is a tedious and labour intensive bottleneck in many renal \ac{MRI} studies. Here a \ac{CNN} is developed to generate fully automated masks of the kidneys with better than human precision.

Finally, many of these techniques are combined with an ex-vivo renal \ac{MRI} protocol to enable future correlation of newly developed quantitative renal \ac{MRI} with existing histopathological pipelines. Correlating these two diagnostic methods should aid clinical adoption of renal \ac{MRI}, increase confidence in diagnostics and improved patient experience.
